3,Full UFO Disclosure Is Inevitable,"Full UFO Disclosure Is Inevitable Nov 18, 2016 7 0 
What is coming can t be stopped. The truth is out there and we know it. While some believe that a partial disclosure of the truth on the UFO/E.T. phenomena will be pulled off, the reality is that any attempts to subvert or spin the truth of this monumental truth will ultimately backfire. The truth is out there. 
According to whistle-blower Corey Goode , the banking and political cabal (some call it the NWO) is bent on releasing the truth about the UFO and extraterrestrial existence, but have that truth spun in a way where this cabal continues to maintain it s power. In the end, the would not serve the greater interests of humanity, as this cabal would still try to keep several of it s methods of enslavement over humanity going. 
However, this scenario is extremely unlikely due to the amount of people who know the truth. It is also unlikely due to the kind of information that is continuing to come out regarding the existence of other beings in our universe. Credible Insiders 
Going back to late 2013, former Canadian Prime Minister and Defense Minister Paul Hellyer said in a TV interview with RT , that he knows for a fact that UFOs are real and that they ve been visiting our planet for thousands of years. He also said that there are at least 4 different species that he knows of and that they want to help us create a peaceful world. He also said they have the technology to completely transform our world for the better. If there would be one interview to send to someone skeptical of this subject, this would be it. Paul Hellyer gave an eye-opening interview. 
In another interview that opened even more eyes was in early 2013 when former NASA Astronaut and Princeton Physics Professor Dr. Brian O Leary told the world: 
There is abundant evidence that we are being contacted and that civilizations have been visiting us for a very long time ¦ 
In the interview he also discusses free energy technology that these beings use. Another famous quote from Dr. O Leary regarding free energy technology is: 
These concepts have been proven in hundreds of laboratories all over the world, yet never see the light of day. If the new energy technologies were set free world wide the change would be profound. It would affect everybody, it would be applicable everywhere. These technologies are absolutely the most important thing that have happened in the history of the world. 
Another prominent figure who has openly spoken about the UFO and free energy reality is former NASA Astronaut Edgar Mitchell. Mitchell was brought back into focus a little over a month ago when Wikileaks revealed emails that Mitchell sent to John Podesta , chairman of the Clinton campaign. 
It is urgent that we agree on a date and time to meet to discuss Disclosure and Zero Point Energy, at your earliest available after your departure. My Catholic colleague Terri Mansfield will be there too, to bring us up to date on the Vatican s awareness of ETI (Extraterrestrial Intelligence). 
Remember, our nonviolent ETI from the contiguous universe are helping us bring zero point energy to Earth. They will not tolerate any forms of military violence on Earth or in space. 
Though these are just three cases of well-known, credible insiders revealing the truth, there are literally thousands more that have come forward over the years. For further insider testimony, take a look at The Disclosure Project video where in 2001, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific insiders came forward and testified what they know about the UFO and E.T. subject. It Won t Stop There 
As truths like this continue to come out, much of what we ve been taught on this planet will need to be addressed and revised. Almost every area of our world has been compromised by this secret cabal. JFK put it best when he openly stated opposition to secret societies, secret oaths and to secret proceedings. As well as opposition to a ruthless conspiracy ¦a highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. 
Indeed, almost everything we see around us has been built on secrecy and lies. Full disclosure is more than just the truth about UFOs and other beings visiting our world. It is also more than the free energy technologies that have been intentionally suppressed. Full disclosure will also include learning about these secret societies that JFK talked about. It will include learning about how a group of elites controlled the media, the schools, the religions, the miltaries, the financial systems as well as controlling the weather (HAARP technology), controlling the food supply and attempting a mass eugenics project through genetically modified foods. 
It will also include learning about the subversion of the scientific method to push their destructive agenda into the health and medical fields. It will include revealing how pharmaceuticals have been used to numb and slowly degrade biological activity within the human body. 
Full disclosure will include learning about the use of chemical weapons on it s own people through what is known as chemtrails. Even the CIA Chief has admitted they are engaging in such geoengineering practices. We could also call this stratospheric aerosol injection. 
Full disclosure will also reveal how the elite s have stolen and have been abusing the global collateral accounts . These accounts were intentionally created to fund massive humanitarian projects and are the real reason JFK was murdered. Full disclosure will reveal the true history behind these accounts and all of the banks, governments (registered corporations) and other corporations (like the United Nations) that have been illegally using these accounts. We will also learn about how the 9/11 false flag is connected to these accounts. 
We will also learn about how our birth certificates have been turned into securities that are being traded on the New York Stock Exchange. We will also learn about how almost every government in this world is actually a registered corporation . We do not have governments running our country. We have masquerading corporations. 
We ll also learn about mind control operations that have been used both on the public, as well as on certain politicians, bankers and celebrities. This is most commonly known as MK Ultra. 
We will also learn about the massive child-trafficking, pedophile ring that the elites have been involved in. 
Even so, there will still be much more that will be revealed. Full Disclosure Now 
While some want to create a partial disclosure, such a scenario is nearly impossible. The reason this is so is that there are many, many scientific, military, political and intelligence related people who know an incredible amount of information, but stay silent to either preserve their life or preserve their job. Once the door cracks open, we will see a few major figures come forth and reveal what they know. Once that happens, we will see the floodgates open. Dozens and then hundreds of people who know the truth on a wide range of topics, such as those listed above, will no longer have the threat of death held against them. They will be free to speak about what they know. 
The world is becoming more ready each day thanks to the internet and information like that contained in this article reaching even more people. The world is awakening to the truth and we know that we already have the technology to turn this planet into a paradise. We know that there are peaceful beings living on other planets and in other dimensions. This is reality. 
You can join the growing Facebook group who is pushing for full disclosure here . 
Lastly, take a look at the words from David Wilcock , NYT Best-Selling author, researcher, lecturer and UFO expert from just a couple days ago : 
I will say that the fight for Disclosure and the defeat of the Cabal is now at a Red Hot level, based on multiple insider testimonies. The scope, power and speed of changes we might see are anyone s guess, but it definitely appears that things are going to get a lot more interesting.",REAL

5,[VIDEO] BUMBLING US DEFENSE SEC. CAN T ANSWER QUESTION ABOUT Whether Or Not We ll Defend The 60 Syrians We re Training To Fight ISIS,"Yeah you know the Obama regime is serious about taking down ISIS when they send in 60 Syrian rebels and leave them unprotected against the Assad regime. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) went straight for the jugular in questioning Defense Secretary Ash Carter at a Tuesday Senate hearing on the Obama administration s strategy against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.McCain criticized President Obama s comments at the Pentagon on Monday citing recent progress against ISIS as delusional, and he ripped Carter over the Pentagon s slowness in training Syrian rebels.He said ISIS overall is gaining territory in Iraq and Syria and that there is no compelling reason to believe the administration s strategy is going to succeed in limiting the group. McCain disparaged the Pentagon for failing to provide military support to the few Syrian rebels it is training after Carter said the military would decide how to provide support once they are in the field. Via: The HillSenator John McCain: And is it true that with these people that you are training and equipping to fight in Syria that they re only there to fight ISIS and not Bashar Assad? Is that true?US Defense Secretary Carter: Ah..we re uh..yes, we are telling them to uh uh that we arming and uh .training them uh in the first instance, to go after ISIL and not uh..the Assad regime and that is our priority. McCain:So, in other words if they are barrel bombed by Bashar Assad, they are not Carter: No I think we have SOME obligation to them once they re inserted in the field. Again, we don t expect them to be McCain: Is that to defend them against barrel bombing?Carter: Well that decision will be made when we introduce fighters into the field.McCain: That s a small comfort to those people you re recruiting right now that that decision will be made later on.Is that fair to these young men to say: We are sending you in to fight ISIS only, and by the way, we will decide on the policy whether to defend you if you are barrel bombed?Carter: They know that we will provide support to them. Exactly what kind of support McCain: Does that mean you will defend them against Bashar Assad s barrel bombing?McCain s final question: So you re recruiting them, but not telling them that you ll defend them because you haven t made a decision yet? And yet you want to train them quickly and send them in?",REAL
6,"The World To Trump: F*ck Off, You Did Not ˜Inherit A Mess From Obama (VIDEO)","With the White House plagued with scandals, Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed the dishonest media for not giving him proper credit after he inherited a mess from former President Barack Obama.We have some bad news for Mr. Trump. The world strongly disagrees with him. Trump has been in office for only 168 days and yet he has already had a major impact on how the world sees the United States.MSNBC s Chris Matthews highlighted a new Pew Research Center poll which shows that Trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe, and ratings for the U.S. have declined steeply in many nations.Trump is wildly unpopular worldwide while Obama s popularity soars above the former reality show star s ratings. 37 nations were included in the poll, showing that a median of just 22% has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs. In contrast to the final years of Barack Obama s presidency, a median of 64% expressed confidence in Trump s predecessor to direct America s role in the world.Watch: This highlights why Trump has exhibited so much jealousy toward his popular predecessor. Trump will never be respected like Obama was and is. Trump s jealously toward Obama was displayed long before he took the oath of office. Obama would never bash the U.S. media and intelligence agencies while on foreign soil. In fact, he never did that in the U.S., but Trump does and did. Obama retaliated against Russia s meddling in our 2016 presidential election by ordering 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country. Obama imposed sanctions against the foreign hostile government, while Trump s administration would like to lift them.The former reality show star is fake news and that can be seen daily in his Twitter timeline but he is good at projection.By the way, Trump is not expected to confront Russian leader Vladimir Putin today at the G20 summit meeting about his country s interference in our presidential election.Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.",REAL
7,State Polls: Trump Gains DRAMATICALLY | Daily Wire,"” Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) October 31, 2016 
Remington Research's summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become ""increasingly competitive"": 
Last week, we found a presidential race where Hillary Clinton held a clear advantage. This week, we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go. Trump appears to be holding strong in his must-win states and Colorado remains within the margin of error. The data also show that Pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category. 
The presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch. Hillary maintains an advantage leading in Colorado and Pennsylvania, but at this point anything can happen, said Titus Bond, Director of Remington Research Group 
Other state polling data came out on Sunday that also showed a close-race between Trump and Clinton, although the polls were surveyed before FBI director James Comey's announcement that they were re-opening their investigation against Clinton . Via RealClearPolitics : Florida: New York Times/Siena: Trump 46 percent, Clinton 42 percent. NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 45 percent, Trump 44 percent. Gravis: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 47 percent. Colorado: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 42 percent, Trump 39 percent. Arizona: CBS/YouGov: Trump 44 percent, Clinton 42 percent. North Carolina: NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 47 percent, Trump 41 percent. Gravis: Clinton 49 percent, Trump 47 percent. CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 45 percent. Pennsylvania: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 40 percent. 
The fact that some of these polls were close even before the Comey announcement led to this observation from FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver: Both things can be true: 1) Comey impact overblown ” Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) October 31, 2016 
Radio host Steve Deace writes at Conservative Review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton, the renewed FBI investigation could ""have a potentially huge impact"" on Election Day: 
Trump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like Arizona, Georgia, Utah, Indiana, and Alaska that rarely go blue on Election Day. It s quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the Clintons could sway the bulk of Republican-leaning undecideds Trump s way. But that s provided, of course, that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as he s been prone to do. Then there s the matter of Trump s emerging Evan McMullin headache in Utah. 
If Trump can be disciplined this final week, his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on Iowa, Nevada, Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina. Those five states would get him within striking distance to 265 Electoral College votes, and then you hope you can pull an upset in Colorado, Pennsylvania, or New Mexico where Trump is visiting during the campaign s final week. The hope is that there s enough voters in those states wearier of Clinton s corruption than worried about whether Trump s fit for office. 
FiveThirtyEight currently has Trump's odds of winning the presidency at 23.6 percent in their polls-plus forecast. This week will be crucial for Trump in increasing those odds, and maybe the FBI's re-opened investigation into Clinton will help improve those odds as it becomes closer to Election Day. Tags",REAL
8,Planned Parenthood Slams Republicans For Pretending To Be Shocked By Trump s Abortion Stance,"When the story broke on Wednesday about Donald Trump saying women should be punished for getting an abortion, I was, honestly, confused by the outrage. People were talking like no one has ever been so far off the deep end. As if punishing women for having an abortion wasn t a central pillar of Republican ideology. All I could think was, But that s what Republicans have been trying to do for years! Why are people shocked? Apparently, I m not the only person to have noticed that:Planned Parenthood Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens said presidential candidate Donald Trump had exposed the real views of many Republicans. A plan to punish women who seek abortion in this country is not news, it s actually the Republican Party platform they re horrified to have been outed for what they do every day, which is punish women who seek abortions. To back laws that tell doctors they must lie to women, to work to shut down clinics, to ban certain procedures that doctors say are important for women s safety and health, she said Thursday morning during an appearance on CNN. I mean, all of these things. That s what their agenda is day in and day out. They do punish women. Yeah, pretty much. But it s worse than that. Republicans have proposed laws that would make it legal to kill abortion providers. They ve criminalized pregnancy in several states which has resulting in a growing trend of women being arrested for miscarrying. The idea of punishing women is not at all a new idea for Republicans. Laguens is exactly right when she says the problem other Republicans have is that Trump is saying it out loud.This has been the main objection to Trump from the GOP the entire time. He s not sophisticated enough to use dog whistles or anything resembling subtlety. He just says what Republicans actually think and want without the veil of respectability they ve built. While it excites a base that s tired of being unable to wear their racism on their sleeve (or their pointy white hood), it s made moderate Republicans and Independents recoil in disgust.As long as Trump continues to expose the core of Republican ideology to the world, he s an enormous threat to their agenda and he s primed to not just lose in November, but lose BIG.Keep up the good work, Donald!Featured image via Getty",REAL
9,BUSTED: Steel Unions FURIOUS At Trump For Destroying American Jobs,"If Trump wants to win the rust belt, he needs to practice what he preaches. After promising multiple times that under his Administration that jobs and business would be brought back to the steelworkers of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Minnesota, a new report detailed that Trump wasn t doing his part to make that happen (shocker, right?). Turns out Trump buys his steel and aluminum for his buildings from China, not the struggling rust belt states and communities.Let me guess: that makes him smart. The Newsweek expose put a major dent in Trump s ability to coalesce blue collar, unionized steelworkers who typically vote Democratic but have been courted heavily by the Republican nominee.President of USW Local 1219, which represents workers at U.S. Steel s Edgar Thomson Works, Jim Johnston, slammed the nominee for failing to follow his own advice and promises at a press conference with other steelworkers and officials, saying:What he says really appeals to our members. But what he does is the total opposite.Braddock, Pennsylvania, which boomed in the 1920s as the epicenter of steel production but lost close to 90 percent of its population after the industry collapsed in the 1970s and 1980s, also felt the sting of Trump s double-talk. Mayor John Fetterman, a Democrat, laid into Trump s lies, telling the local press:Donald Trump pretends to be in the corner of steelworkers when the facts as always with Donald Trump show otherwise.If Donald Trump loses the support of the steelworkers, he can kiss Pennsylvania (and possibly Ohio) goodbye. With Hillary Clinton rising in the polls and making ground in the state, Trump will have to claw his way back after a series of devastating revelations about the candidate have been made public.Pennsylvania s next door neighbor, Ohio, is also not so forgiving, even among Republicans. Lourenco Goncalves, president and CEO of Cleveland-based Cliffs Natural Resources, said:It s just another example of who he is. He works for Donald Trump, not the common good. I m a Republican, but I just can t support a guy like Donald Trump.Just across the Great Lakes, in Minnesota, criticism has been sharper. USW President Leo W. Gerard went full anti-Trump in a statement to Duluth News Tribune:The USW, though not surprised by Trump s actions, is furious over his efforts to undercut key American manufacturing jobs in the construction of his buildings he so often brags about. The investigation from Newsweek released Monday is a shocking expose on Trump s plan to not only buy his steel and aluminum from the Chinese, but to use shell companies and corporate black holes to try and hide his greed even as he was planning to run for president.John Rebrovich, assistant to the director of USW District 11 in Minnesota, also told Duluth:We ve got 12,000 steelworkers at steel mills out of work and another 10,000 at aluminium mills and he s buying Chinese steel through shell companies. That s not making America great again. That s killing our jobs.Ouch. Trump s greatest chance on winning these traditionally Democratic states may have just completely turned against him, and for good reason. They have been ravaged enough. They don t need a bombastic billionaire promising them all these wonderful things when he doesn t even do his part to alleviate their suffering. Why didn t Trump contract these workers? Chances are he would have stiffed them, but even the extension of doing business would have meant the world to these hardworking Americans. But Trump, as usual, picks China to do his bidding.Featured image via Ralp Freso/Getty images",REAL

11,More than 400 U.S. troops leaving Syria: coalition,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 400 U.S. Marines and their artillery are leaving Syria after helping to capture the city of Raqqa from Islamic State, the U.S.-led coalition fighting the militant group said on Thursday. Last month, U.S.-backed militias declared victory in Raqqa, Islamic State s former headquarters in Syria, after months of fighting with the help of the U.S.-led coalition. With the city liberated and ISIS on the run, the unit has been ordered home. Its replacements have been called off, the coalition said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State. We re drawing down combat forces where it makes sense, but still continuing our efforts to help Syrian and Iraqi partners maintain security, Brigadier General Jonathan Braga, the director of operations for the coalition, said in the statement. Our remaining forces will continue to work by, with, and through partner forces to defeat remaining ISIS, prevent a re-emergence of ISIS, and set conditions for international governments and NGOs to help local citizens recover from the horrors of ISIS short-lived rule, he said. Officially, the Pentagon says there are 503 troops in Syria. However, as of last week, U.S. officials said there were closer to 2,000 U.S. troops in the country. The latest announcement would reduce that number. As that campaign against Islamic State winds down, it is unclear how many, if any, U.S. troops will remain in Syria. Most of them are special operations forces, working to train and advise local partner forces, including providing artillery support against Islamic State militants. Separately, Russia said it was already preparing to withdraw its military contingent from Syria, Russian news agencies reported.",FAKE

Saying that Trump changes more positions than yoga, Navarro blasted the billionaire mogul for his racism and blatant disregard of the Constitution: I gotta tell you, I m a lawyer, I am a Hispanic it is offensive from a legal perspective, it is highly offensive as a Hispanic. What he is doing is wagging the dog. He is trying to distract from the fact he has got a problem with a case where there are allegations that his business is a scam and a fraud. How dare he, how dare he question a judge s responsibility, a judge s adherence to the Constitution because he is of Mexican descent. Then Navarro got personal, and cut Donald Trump to the bone with some cold hard facts about Mexicans and people of Hispanic descent: This man was born in eastern Chicago. He s an American citizen. He is just as American as Donald Trump. Mexican Americans bleed just as any other American when they go to war. They bled, just as any other American on 9/11. They fight for America, they are America. And what he is doing is disgusting, I am livid about it. If this is his strategy to win over Hispanics, he s got a hell of a wake up call coming to him in November. Only Donald Trump could piss off two influential Hispanic Republican women first Susana Martinez, and now Ana Navarro. What a great strategy Trump has, as Navarro sarcastically pointed out.Currently, only 14 percent of Hispanics have a favorable rating of Donald Trump. Among nonwhite women, which includes Hispanics and Latinas, the number is a record low 9 percent.And what is Trump doing to get their vote? Absolutely nothing. No wonder Navarro is pissed. Republicans had a chance to reach out to Hispanic and Latino voters after their 2012 autopsy and they chose the guy who would do the exact opposite.Navarro is right, he is wagging the dog. Trump honestly believes he can win with just the white male vote.

However the opportunity also presents the party with a conundrum. FDP leader Christian Lindner has signaled for months that he would prefer to lead the business-friendly party in parliament rather than take a cabinet job under Merkel. If Lindner sticks to his stance then the FDP, which is returning to parliament after a four-year hiatus, must find someone else to fill one of the most important positions in international economic and financial policy. The person who replaces Schaeuble could also carry the prestigious title of vice chancellor. The only party member besides Lindner with that kind of stature is Wolfgang Kubicki, whose political skills are unquestioned but who is also known as a loose cannon, a reputation that may not suit a sensitive job where a few ill-judged words can move global financial markets. If it is not Lindner, then there are not a lot of options, said one senior figure in the party. Kubicki might be the only one with the profile and political weight. The finance ministry seems to be the FDP s for the taking. As the second biggest party in what is expected to be a three-way coalition with Merkel s conservatives and the Greens, it would have first choice of cabinet post. The post has become more influential over the past decade as Germany, the world s fourth largest economy, navigated the global financial crisis and euro zone turmoil. Schaeuble, who is becoming president of the parliament, was known for his budget discipline and tough stance toward struggling euro partners like Greece. Whoever replaces him will play a crucial role in shaping Germany s response to calls from French President Emmanuel Macron for an ambitious overhaul of the EU and euro zone. The finance ministry will be absolutely crucial in the next government in shaping not just Germany s fiscal stance but the future of Europe, said Jens Boysen-Hogrefe of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. No one besides Lindner deserves more credit for the FDP s revival after its disastrous 2013 election result than the 65-year-old Kubicki, a quick-witted lawyer who sails around on his yacht Liberty and is known as one of the most outspoken, colorful figures in German politics. Earlier this year, after Donald Trump announced his travel ban on seven mainly Muslim countries, Kubicki said Berlin should retaliate by barring the U.S. president from entering Germany. He has made clear in the past that he is interested in the finance job. In a 2010 interview with newspaper Die Zeit, he said it was the only position that might lure him from his home in the port of Kiel in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein. Only one post would interest me, finance minister, Kubicki said at the time. Finance minister is the key job, and I would like to prove that budget consolidation can work. Asked on Friday by German daily Handelsblatt whether he wanted the job, Kubicki dodged the question, saying policy was more important than cabinet posts. But the interview with Die Zeit showed why the party, and Merkel, might have second thoughts. Explaining why he hadn t yet made a move to Berlin, Kubicki told the paper that if he did, he could turn into a drinker and possibly also a whoremonger . He then painted a hedonistic picture of political life in Berlin, replete with alcohol-soaked receptions and trysts with random women. When asked about these comments today, Kubicki who is married to his third wife, says he has become ethically and morally centered in the intervening years. The names of other FDP politicians are circulating as potential finance ministers. They include Werner Hoyer, president of the European Investment Bank (EIB); Carl-Ludwig Thiele of the Bundesbank; Volker Wissing, the former head of the Bundestag finance committee; and Otto Fricke, former head of the budget committee. Two members of the European Parliament, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff and Michael Theurer, have also been mentioned. One cannot completely rule out that Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) will keep the post. If they do, Peter Altmaier, who is expected to replace Schaeuble until the new government is formed, could be a favorite. However, the scenario that several politicians in Berlin said was most likely is that Lindner will be compelled to take the finance ministry, with Kubicki sliding in as parliamentary leader, which is seen as a role more suited to his strengths. Having Lindner, the face of the FDP, outside the government would be frowned upon by Merkel, who will be trying to hold together an unwieldy coalition with the FDP and Greens, a combination that has never been tried at the federal level. There are big differences between the FDP and Greens on economic, environmental and European policy. Add in Merkel s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), which is pushing a hard line on immigration, and it is hard to see how the parties will bridge some policy gaps and hold together. Regardless of who takes the job, big changes in fiscal policy are seen as unlikely. The FDP has called for 30 billion euros in tax cuts, but it is unlikely to get its way in the coalition talks and it remains committed to the Schwarze Null balanced budget that Schaeuble defended. You might see new impulses with an FDP finance minister, said Boysen-Hogrefe of the Kiel institute. But don t count on big changes. The Schwarze Null will remain a priority.",FAKE

The French government is under fire for quietly issuing a decree establishing a mega-database of personal details of 60 million French citizens, a move privacy campaigners view as potentially dangerous. 
The database established by the decree issued by Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve will affect every holder of a French passport or identity card, except for children under 12 years of age. 
Information to be stored includes a photo, date and place of birth, address, eye color, weight and marital status. Fingerprints were to have been included too, although Cazeneuve dropped that plan amid massive criticism.

17,Oil business seen in strong position as Trump tackles tax reform,"(This January 3 story was corrected to remove reference in paragraph 8 to ConocoPhillips, which is not an integrated oil company) By David Morgan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big Oil could be in a unique position to protect its interests against a Republican proposal to tax imports, given that President-elect Donald Trump s cabinet is studded with oil champions sensitive to the risk of higher gasoline prices. Trump s emerging leadership includes Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Trump himself has made no secret of his support for the energy sector. And in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats have close industry ties, including House tax panel chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican whose district takes in the northern Houston suburbs. House Republicans want to adopt a sweeping tax reform that would sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and end the taxation of U.S. corporate overseas profits. But a provision known as border adjustability is stirring up controversy. Though intended to boost U.S. manufacturing by exempting export revenues from tax, the provision worries some industries because it would also tax imports. Because U.S. oil refiners import about half the crude oil they use to make gasoline, diesel and other products, analysts say the change could lead to higher gasoline prices and potentially undermine economic growth. Integrated oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron Corp, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc could also be hit, depending on whether they are net importers. But the industry s allies would likely move to soften any rough edges, analysts say. I don t see this mix of leadership figures in the House, Senate and the White House, doing something that has the effect of raising gasoline prices, said Peter Cohn, an energy analyst with Height Securities, a Washington-based investment firm. The danger is that a move to protect the oil refiners could open the door to assistance for other industries, including retailers and automakers, which would also face higher costs if no longer able to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income. Such a knock-on effect could prevent border adjustability from raising an expected $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for lower tax rates over the next decade. We hope that raising these concerns early in the process will allow members of Congress to consider the issues carefully, Chet Thompson, president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, said in a statement. Brady said earlier this month that his committee was sensitive to the impact on specific businesses and listening very closely to how we can make sure we smooth that out. Moreover, some economists dismiss industry worries about higher import costs, saying the dollar s value would rise in response to such sweeping tax changes and ultimately reduce the cost of imports. Currency markets would adjust to higher oil prices by lowering the dollar value of crude, they predict. This argument by the oil industry is, frankly, all wrong, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who now heads the American Action Forum think tank. Refiners are going to be basically held harmless. They ll have a lower dollar price of oil. Net cost is the same. And they go about their business. I m unsympathetic, he added. Height Securities Cohn said Trump and his advisers could look for ways to soften any blow to refiners and their customers: Trump doesn t want to have refineries closing on his watch. Oil already benefits from several tax code provisions in place for decades that would be eliminated under the House Republican plan. But they stand to gain more than they will lose. For instance, an existing tax deduction for domestic production lets oil producers shave down their corporate tax rate to 32 percent from the top headline rate of 35 percent. Under the congressional Republicans plan, the corporate rate would be cut to 20 percent; under Trump s plan, to 15 percent. Similarly, companies that now write off intangible drilling costs or get a tax allowance for asset depletion would be able to immediately expense capital investments. Then there is a tax credit oil companies claim for fees from foreign countries. Congressional Republicans would eliminate foreign taxes altogether, while Trump would maintain taxation at a substantially lower rate.",FAKE
18,Hilarious Rare Video Shows How Hillary Prepared To Avoid A Trump Hug,"By now, we re all aware of how Donald Trump repeatedly humiliates the nation with his handshake games. He awkwardly tugs people in some kind of attempted power play, holds on to their hands for far too long, and, in the most inhospitable move of all, attempts to give them unwanted hugs.Well, during the 2016 presidential campaign, it appears that Hillary Clinton s team had observed this bizarre behavior, and made sure that when she met Trump for debates, Hillary was ready to avoid the gross awkwardness of an unwanted Trump hug in front of millions of debate viewers.On Friday, longtime Clinton aide Phillip Reines released a rare clip from debate prep, in which he played Donald Trump. In the clip, Reines as Trump attempts to hug Hillary, and she runs away from him.While funny, it really does show just how bizarre Trump s behavior is, and it speaks to a larger issue with his mental state. Anyone who acts like that with people they are opposing politically, or worse, meeting for the purpose of diplomacy, has serious issues.We re not the only ones who think so, either. Just Google the videos of Trump s Oval Office meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, or any other world leader Trump has behaved this way with. They all look either disgusted, alarmed, horrified, insulted, or some combination thereof. And of course, we can t leave out the reports that now-former FBI Director James Comey was, quote, disgusted with the forced half-hug Trump gave him for the cameras.Oh well, at least we get this bit of Hillary humor while we witness and live through what is easily the craziest, most bizarre presidency in the history of this great nation.Watch the video below:Not easy to avoid the unwanted Trump hug, sometimes it even takes practice A favorite moment from debate prep (9/24/16): pic.twitter.com/JAAHaqKFoa Philippe Reines (@PhilippeReines) May 19, 2017Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",REAL
19,Assange: Clinton Campaign Tried To Hack WikiLeaks,"Edmondo Burr in News , World // 0 Comments Julian Assange claims that Hillary Clinton s campaign used hackers to attack WikiLeaks servers. 
WikiLeaks editor-in-chief says that despite the Ecuadorian embassy shutting down its internet to stop accusations of interference in U.S. elections, his organisation will keep on publishing until the elections are over. 
RT.com reports: 
Everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict, Assange said via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday. 
The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clinton s campaign chair, John Podesta, on a daily basis since early October. 
Assange claimed the release whipped up a crazed hornet s nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign leading them to attack WikiLeaks. 
They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile, he added. 
Ecuador s decision to shut down his internet was described by Assange as a strategic position so that its policy of non-intervention can t be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador. 
He said he was sympathetic with Ecuador, insisting they face the dilemma of having the US interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the US elections next month. MORE: #WikiLeaks has activated contingency plans after #Assange ˜s internet link was intentionally cut off https://t.co/octsMseme1 
” RT (@RT_com) 17 October 2016 
Assange, who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference, said he did not agree with Ecuador s decision but did understand it. WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said. 
He did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, this is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process “ for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform. 
He also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being controlled by Clinton supporters. We were fastest on #Podestaemails6 , faster than @wikileaks , and the US conspiracy machine can t handle it https://t.co/njAae50qDd 
” RT (@RT_com) 13 October 2016 
The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. I don t think there s any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton, he said. 
Assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view Trump as representing what in their mind is white trash.",REAL
20,"""Hamilton"" Actor Refuses To Apologize For Political Stunt","by Ike Mclean / November 21, 2016 / CRAZY LEFT / 
Vice President-elect Mike Pence was attending the Broadway Musical Hamilton on Friday night when the cast decided to send a political message to Trump and his administration. 
Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor who played the part of Vice President Aaron Burr during the musical about the life of the Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, acknowledged that Pence was in the crowd and then said the following: 
We, sir ” we ” are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights. We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us. 
Dixon was asked on CBS This Morning Monday about the decision to deliver his political message, which prompted Donald Trump to take to Twitter and say that Pence was harassed and that the cast was very rude. 
The president-elect is demanding an apology, CBS anchor Charlie Rose said to Dixon during the Monday morning interview. 
I heard, Dixon responded. 
We assume that no apology is forthcoming? Rose asked. 
There is nothing to apologize for, Dixon said. 
Dixon then added that this is certainly not the first time, nor will it be the last, that somebody went into a theater and began to act inappropriately or stand up and interrupt the show.

21,Why Are So Many People Popping Vitamin D? - The New York Times,"There was no reason for the patients to receive vitamin D tests. They did not have osteoporosis their bones were not cracking from a lack of the vitamin. They did not have diseases that interfere with vitamin D absorption. Yet in a recent sample of 800, 000 patients in Maine, nearly one in five had had at least one test for blood levels of the vitamin over a period. More than a third got two or more tests, often to evaluate such complaints as malaise or fatigue. The researchers who gathered the data, Dr. Kathleen Fairfield and Kim Murray of the Maine Medical Center, were surprised. Perhaps they shouldn t have been. Millions of people are popping supplements in the belief that vitamin D can help turn back depression, fatigue, muscle weakness, even heart disease or cancer. In fact, there has never been widely accepted evidence that vitamin D is helpful in preventing or treating any of those conditions. But so firm is this belief that vitamin D has become popular even among people with no particular medical complaints or disease risks. And they are being tested for vitamin D deficiency in ever greater numbers. The number of blood tests for vitamin D levels among Medicare beneficiaries, mostly people 65 and older, increased from 2000 to 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among patients with commercial insurance, testing rates rose 2. from 2009 to 2014. Labs performing these tests are reporting perfectly normal levels of vitamin D ” 20 to 30 nanograms per milliliter of blood ” as insufficient. As a consequence, millions of healthy people think they have a deficiency, and some are taking supplemental doses so high they can be dangerous, causing poor appetite, nausea and vomiting. Vitamin D overdoses also can lead to weakness, frequent urination and kidney problems. A lot of clinicians are acting like there is a pandemic of vitamin D deficiency, said Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, a preventive medicine researcher at Brigham and Women s Hospital in Boston who helped write an Institute of Medicine report on vitamin D. That gives them justification to screen everyone and get everyone well above what the Institute of Medicine recommends. In fact, the institute committee on which Dr. Manson served concluded in 2010 that very few people were vitamin D deficient and noted that randomized trials had found no particular benefit for healthy people to have blood levels above 20 nanograms per milliliter. Medical organizations, too, have repeatedly found that there is no reason to assess vitamin D levels in healthy adults, and recently two rigorous studies failed to find that high doses of the vitamin protect against heart disease or cancer. Still, vitamin D has become a religion, said Dr. Clifford J. Rosen, an osteoporosis researcher at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute and a member of the Institute of Medicine s committee. Vitamin D is a nutrient needed to absorb calcium and phosphorus, and therefore to make bones strong. People do not make their own: We need sunlight to synthesize vitamin D. The vitamin also is found in oily fish and in a few other foods, including milk, which is fortified with the vitamin. Because many people have little exposure to sunlight, especially those living in northern climates in winter, some investigators became concerned more than a decade ago that large swaths of the population were not getting enough vitamin D. One is Dr. Michael F. Holick, a professor of medicine, physiology and biophysics at Boston University School of Medicine and a leading proponent of the idea that just about everyone needs a vitamin D supplement. He points to studies that suggest an association between low vitamin D levels and higher rates of various diseases. While these observational reports do not prove cause and effect, he is persuaded by the fact that many point in the same direction, hinting that low blood levels of vitamin D are hazardous. Doctors, he believes, must take action. The recommended daily allowance is 600 international units up to age 70, and 800 I. U. for people who are older, Dr. Holick said. Diet cannot provide that much of the vitamin, he notes. And it would require nearly constant exposure to sunlight to reach the levels he recommends. Over the years, he acknowledged, studies in which people were randomly assigned to take a vitamin D pill or a placebo have failed to support claims for the vitamin s benefits. But those studies tended to be too small to be definitive, he said. Yet recent trials, larger and more rigorous, also have not produced the results. One study with 5, 108 participants, published this month in JAMA Cardiology, found that vitamin D did not prevent heart attacks. Another study, published at the end of March, included 2, 303 healthy postmenopausal women randomly assigned to take vitamin D and calcium supplements or a placebo. The supplements did not protect the women against cancer, the researchers concluded. Other, more ambitious studies are underway, including a randomized study of almost 26, 000 healthy men and women directed by Dr. Manson and Julie Buring, who hope to answer once and for all whether taking vitamin D can prevent cancer, heart disease and strokes. The frenzy for vitamin D began not in natural food stores but in medical journals. Beginning around 2000, a series of research papers linked vitamin D levels that are lower, but considered normal, to multiple sclerosis and mental illness, then to cancer risk and bone health. Blood testing for the vitamin took off. Patients began asking for it, said Dr. Fairfield, the researcher in Maine. A lot of people thought that if they were fatigued or sad or they did not feel well, they might be vitamin D deficient. In 2007, Dr. Holick published a paper in The New England Journal of Medicine asserting that vitamin D levels now considered normal ” 21 to 29 nanograms per milliliter of blood ” were linked to an increased risk of cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes, schizophrenia, depression, poor lung capacity and wheezing. He also published books promoting the idea that vitamin D levels in that range were insufficient to promote good health. In 2011, a committee of the Endocrine Society, headed by Dr. Holick, came out with a recommendation that vitamin D levels be at least 30 nanograms per milliliter, which meant that most people were vitamin D deficient. The group recommended the taking of supplements but not widespread testing, on the grounds that this would not be . The new guideline had an immediate effect: Commercial labs began describing levels of 20 to 30 nanograms per milliliter as insufficient. Many continue to do so today. There was a vitamin D bandwagon, said Dr. Sundeep Khosla, an osteoporosis expert at the Mayo Clinic. Vitamin D tests became incorporated into the general evaluation of patients, he added. Ravinder J. Singh, who runs a testing lab at the Mayo Clinic, was taken aback by the sudden deluge. Demand for vitamin D testing went through the sky, he said. It was almost as though there was nothing else serious in clinical practice. Dr. Fairfield, like many other general practitioners, began testing patients, trying to make sure they raised their vitamin D levels above 29 and became concerned that she and other doctors had been too cavalier about the vitamin. We were worried that there was a lot we were missing, she said. But when the Institute of Medicine report proved critical of the vitamin D craze, she started telling healthy patients there was no reason for them to be tested. Many did not want to hear that advice. People were used to vitamin D monitoring, like with cholesterol, Dr. Fairfield said. They wanted to know what their number is. Although Dr. Fairfield stopped routine vitamin D testing, many others have not. Becky Rosen, 64, a nurse who is director of clinical services at a home health agency in Brunswick, Me. had a physical exam four years ago and was told she needed a vitamin D test. She declined. Her next physical exam was in February, with a different doctor. Once again, the doctor wanted to test her vitamin D level. I said, ˜I don t think I need it, Ms. Rosen said. The doctor persisted, explaining that Maine is so far north that people may not be exposed to much sunlight. Once again, Ms. Rosen politely but firmly declined. But she is a special patient: Her husband, Dr. Rosen, helped write the Institute of Medicine report that was critical of vitamin D supplements. I can see other people getting persuaded, Ms. Rosen said.",FAKE
22,In the battle for Hollywood endorsements - and cash - Clinton rules,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders positions on fracking, free tuition and breaking up big banks wouldn t sound out of place in an Oscar winning-actor s acceptance speech. But in famously liberal Hollywood, long used as an ATM by Democratic campaigns, Sanders message is not resonating as loudly as in other progressive bastions. The more moderate Hillary Clinton has far outpaced the Vermont senator in fundraising and has a deep line-up of A-list stars and top executives among her backers. Celebrities don t sway votes, but they can persuade people to listen to a candidate s message, said historian Steven Ross, author of Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics. It puts a candidate on their radar, he said. Hollywood actors, studio executives and other employees of the film, TV and music industries have donated at least $8.4 million to Clinton s campaign and the independent Super PAC that supports her bid, Priorities USA Action, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance data through March 31. A pair of Clinton fundraisers held by actor George Clooney this month, at which tickets went for as much as $353,000 per couple, is not included in that total, but were reported by Deadline Hollywood to have raised an additional $15 million. By contrast, Sanders' campaign had raised about $1 million from entertainment industry donors through March 31, according to the campaign finance data. The Vermont senator, who called the price of the Clooney event ""obscene,"" is not associated with a Super PAC and says he does not court wealthy donors. (Graphic on Hollywood flows to Sanders and Clinton: tmsnrt.rs/1U98K4g) All Republican presidential candidates combined collected $460,000, roughly 5 percent of entertainment industry donations, the data showed. Clinton s support in Hollywood can be traced back to strong ties her husband built during his first presidential campaign in 1992, said Donna Bojarsky, a Democratic public policy consultant who worked as national entertainment coordinator for Bill Clinton s campaign. Bill Clinton connected deeply with Hollywood, she said, in part because he showed a real respect for and appreciation of pop culture. He followed it, and he enjoyed it. Another reason for Hillary Clinton s success in Hollywood is the backing of executives. While business people in Hollywood may be liberals, they are less likely to embrace a candidate who attacks corporations, said Ross, the historian. Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist who wants higher taxes on wealthy people and corporations to help pay for college, healthcare, and other programs. Corporate Hollywood is about business and the bottom line, Ross said. The biggest Hollywood contributors to date are behind-the-scenes figures rather than stars, with about two-thirds of Clinton s industry support through March coming from just three donors. Haim Saban, CEO of Saban Capital Group, contributed $3.5 million, while DreamWorks Animation DWA.O CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and director Steven Spielberg donated $1 million each to Clinton and funds supporting her. But it is the celebrity backers who make headlines for a candidate, even if they re not making hefty contributions. Pop singer Demi Lovato performed at a Clinton campaign rally, and Scandal star Kerry Washington recorded radio and TV ads for the former secretary of state. I really believe in her capacity to deliver on her messages, Washington said in an interview. Sanders welcomed the band Vampire Weekend onto a stage in Iowa, where they joined the candidate to sing This Land Is Your Land. The Red Hot Chili Peppers performed at a Sanders fundraiser in Los Angeles. Clinton s celebrity support skews toward older men and women, and she attracts more minorities, while younger personalities gravitate to Sanders, said Dan Schnur, director of University of Southern California s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and a former Republican political strategist. These leanings reflect those of voters in general, Schnur said, though there are plenty of exceptions. Ninety-year-old actor Dick Van Dyke, a Sanders supporter, is happy to buck the trend. People in my generation are set in their ways, Van Dyke said in an interview. Some people are afraid he might get a little too drastic, that he might do something to upset the apple cart. Sanders, not known for his sense of humor, has also attracted a number of comedians as supporters, including Danny DeVito, Bill Maher and Sarah Silverman. Bernie is not for sale, says Silverman, a one-time Clinton backer, in a pro-Sanders video viewed more than 32 million times on Facebook. This is a once-in-a-lifetime candidate who genuinely represents the people. Schnur finds Sanders support among some comedians understandable. If you decide to perform comedy for a living, you ve probably got a little bit of an anarchist streak, he said, and Sanders challenges the establishment. THE BERNIE-HILLARY SPLIT At times the Sanders-Clinton divide in Hollywood has grown heated. When actor Susan Sarandon, a Sanders supporter, said in an MSNBC interview last month that she wasn t sure she could vote for Clinton if she was the Democratic nominee, the reaction in Hollywood was intense. Her comments were seen as lending support to Trump. Actor Jamie Lee Curtis, a Clinton supporter, tweeted that she respected but disagreed with Sarandon, calling her position dangerous 2 women, minorities & migrants. Debra Messing, one of the stars of NBC sitcom Will and Grace, also joined the Twitter fray, criticizing Sarandon for representing the Bernie or BUST position which is so dangerous for our country. Sarandon, who has donated $2,700 to Sanders, said her comments were reported incorrectly. Of course I wouldn t vote for Trump, she said in an interview with Reuters. She is unrepentant in her support for Sanders. We have to do something more than incremental change, Sarandon said. Sanders is about real change, progressive change, she said. She said she worries about an industry backlash against Sanders supporters, given the reaction to her statements, as well as negative comments from feminist Gloria Steinem and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about women supporting Sanders. It s a much easier thing to be supporting Hillary than to be supporting Bernie if you are a woman in the industry. In the end, Hollywood s Democrats will unite behind Clinton if she wins the nomination, predicted USC s Schnur. A Sanders-nista is not going to flip over and vote Republican, he said.",FAKE
23,What is Comey up to and who is he working for?,"Posted on October 31, 2016 by Michael Collins FBI Director James Comey. Wikimedia 
FBI Director James Comey s letter to Congress on new evidence in the Clinton email scandal represents interference in the presidential campaign commensurate with his failure to indict candidate Hillary Clinton for crimes greater than those committed by citizens that are now serving time. His actions are a paradigm for the dysfunctional and dangerous state of the political system in the United States. 
UPDATE : Two former Republican Attorneys General harshly criticized FBI Director James Comey for his letter to Congress on the Hillary Clinton email affair. Michael Collins 5:42 EDT Mukasey blasts Comey and attorney general over Clinton email case Louis Nelson 10/31/16 07:16 AM EDT 
Director Comey s letter to Congress of October 28 about emails that appear to be pertinent in the [Clinton] investigation was a deliberate, premeditated action that will harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton s chances in the presidential election. His letter may have an even greater impact on Democratic Party down-ballot candidates in Senate and House races and, as a result, influence the post election balance of power in Congress. 
There is no question that Comey knew that his actions would have significant political impact just days before the election. The fact that he defied established procedures of the Justice Department and instructions from superiors shows the intentional nature of his acts. 
Comey s abuse of power and illegal interference in the election is another major marker on the road to the total evisceration of constitutional rights and protection begun in earnest with the Patriot Act of 2001 . His actions should be judged as a blatantly illegal act by one of the nation s most powerful law enforcement officials. It doesn t matter if you support Clinton, Trump, Johnson, or Stein. Allowing the FBI to get away with this outrageous attempt to influence elections kills any hope of finally achieving the goal of an open political process and fair elections. 
Comey s Profound Insincerity 
The Department of Justice has established policies for handling legal matters that may impact an election. Former Attorney s General Janet Reno and Eric Holder outlined policies stating that the Justice Department should avoid prosecutions or other actions close to elections that might influence those elections. Attorney General Loretta Lynch made this point to Comey. Despite reports that FBI agents had not been able to review any of the material, because the bureau had not yet gotten a search warrant to read them, Comey somehow deduced that the emails might be significant. He took the unusual step of informing Congress about the emails he had yet to examine. 
Former Assistant United States Attorney , Nick Ackerman, argued: 
Director Comey acted totally inappropriately. He had no business writing to Congress about supposed new emails that neither he nor anyone in the FBI has ever reviewed. 
Does Director Comey think we are idiots? Clearly, he went out of his way to influence the election in a conspicuous fashion. There can be no doubt about this assertion. 
After some significant blowback from former Justice officials, Comey felt compelled to write an explanatory memo to FBI employees. He said: 
I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record [of the original email investigation]. At the same time, however, given that we don t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don t want to create a misleading impression. In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it. James Comey memo to FBI employees, Washington Post, Oct 28, 2016 , 
This passage from his letter is an admission that Comey knew his actions would influence the election. Before know[ing] the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, he released an update to Congress that could easily be interpreted as an indication that there was a significant development in the Clinton case. Why else would he write the letter? 
Comey told FBI employees, I don t want to create a misleading impression. If Comey wanted to avoid a misleading impression, he might have told the truth if he insisted on writing a memo to Congress. Based on what we know now, he should have said: 
There are some emails on the computer belonging to a close Clinton aid. No one at FBI has seen the emails. We don t even have a warrant to download them. These emails might or might not be important enough to warrant reopening the investigation. 
The fact that Comey failed to tell the truth about the status of the emails proves his ill intent toward the Clinton campaign. 
Comey s Violation of Law 
The 1939 Hatch Act bars Federal employees from a broad range of political activities. 
Richard Painter, a former lawyer in the Bush White House Counsel s office, filed a formal complaint against FBI Director Comey for violating that act. He argued: I believe that the Hatch Act and ethics rules are violated if it is obvious that the official s actions [Comey s] could influence the election, there is not another good reason for taking those actions, and the official is acting under pressure from persons who obviously want to influence the election. 
Comey s actions will clearly influence the elections. There was no good reason to release the memo on evidence not yet reviewed or analyzed. And, Comey admits that he acted under pressure from critics in Congress, Republicans, who obviously want to influence the election. 
In addition, Painter cited another law on the use of public office for private gain. Painter refers to the following section of the United States Code: 
2635.702 Use of public office for private gain. 
An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise ¦ 
Comey s actions have the direct effect of endorsing the Trump campaign enterprise. Trump has insisted again and again that the email case be reopened. Comey reopened it on the flimsiest of grounds. The net effect of his actions props up the Trump campaign just when it looked like the enterprise was finished. 
Comey s Reports to ¦ ? 
Comey s actions serve the Trump campaign and its donors. It wasn t an easy form of service by the FBI Director. Comey had to ignore established policies, common sense, his superior, the Attorney General, and the Hatch Act in order to send his very high impact letter. 
Will it be worth it? 
If Comey acted on his own without any outside inducements or threats, we should all pause and say a short prayer for him. In that scenario, he is an utter fool playing in a league way above his skill set and doing great and memorable damage to the political process. 
But, Comey is no fool. I wrote favorably about his willingness to stand up to the Bush White House in 2007, Comey s Evidence of a Crime . Then, he seemed to have a quality not often seen in government or corporate environments “ a willingness to stand up to the boss. That may have been true at the time. Today, however, Comey seems unable to decide who his boss is. He clearly caved in to the administration and the Clinton interests when he failed to indict Hillary Clinton for even a misdemeanor for her many violations of national security policies. Now, he s caving into the interests of the Republicans and the repellant Trump campaign. 
The key question is who got to Comey and how? 
We know that both Clinton and Trump are unfit for the presidency or any other elected or appointed office in the United States. However, we need to know who has the type of power and force to make the FBI Director behave like a fool.",REAL
24,Travelers Stranded and Protests Swell Over Trump Order - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON ” Travelers were stranded around the world, protests escalated in the United States and anxiety rose within President Trump s party on Sunday as his order closing the nation to refugees and people from certain predominantly Muslim countries provoked a crisis just days into his administration. The White House pulled back on part of Mr. Trump s temporary ban on visitors from seven countries by saying that it would not apply to those with green cards granting them permanent residence in the United States. By the end of the day, the Department of Homeland Security formally issued an order declaring such legal residents exempt from the order. But the recalibration did little to reassure critics at home or abroad who saw the president s order as a retreat from traditional American values. European leaders denounced the order, and some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to back down. As of Sunday evening, officials said no one was being held at American airports, although lawyers said they believed that dozens were still being detained. More than any of the myriad moves Mr. Trump has made in his frenetic opening days in office, the immigration order has quickly come to define his emerging presidency as one driven by a desire for decisive action even at the expense of deliberate process or coalition building. It has thrust the administration into its first constitutional conflict, as multiple courts have intervened to block aspects of the order, and into its broadest diplomatic incident, with overseas allies objecting. The White House was left to defend what seemed to many government veterans like a slapdash process. Aides to Mr. Trump insisted they had consulted for weeks with relevant officials, but the head of the customs and border service in the Obama administration, who resigned on inauguration day, said the incoming president s team never talked with him about it. White House officials blamed what they portrayed as a hyperventilating news media for the confusion and said the order had been successfully carried out. Only about 109 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours, out of the 325, 000 who typically enter the United States in a day, they said. As of Sunday evening, the Department of Homeland Security said 392 green card holders had been granted waivers to enter. That did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with American lives. We re not willing to be wrong on this subject, he said on Face the Nation on CBS. President Trump is not willing to take chances on this subject. The order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days and from Syria indefinitely. It blocks any visitors for 90 days from seven designated countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the order would bar green card holders from those seven countries from returning to the United States. With thousands of protesters chanting outside his White House windows and thronging the streets of Washington and other cities, Mr. Trump late on Sunday defended his order. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting, he said in a written statement. This is not about religion ” this is about terror and keeping our country safe. He noted that the seven countries were identified by former President Barack Obama s administration as sources of terrorism and that his order did not affect citizens from dozens of other predominantly Muslim countries. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days, he said. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for victims of the civil war in Syria. I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria, he said. My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president, I will find ways to help all those who are suffering. While Mr. Trump denied that his action focused on religion, the first iteration of his plan during his presidential campaign was framed as a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors. As late as Sunday morning, he made clear that his concern was for Christian refugees, and part of his order gives preferential treatment to Christians who try to enter the United States from nations. In a Twitter post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump deplored the killing of Christians in the Middle East without noting the killings of Muslims, who have been killed in vastly greater numbers in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. Christians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers, he wrote. We cannot allow this horror to continue! His order, however, resulted in a second day of uncertainty at American airports. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was investigating reports that officials were not complying with court orders in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago. New York s attorney general sent a letter to federal authorities demanding a list of all individuals detained at Kennedy International Airport. The Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday evening that it was in compliance with judicial orders. Still, at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, even the arrival of four Democratic members of Congress did not prompt customs officers to acknowledge whether they were holding anyone or provide lawyers access to anyone detained. The lawmakers arrived after 3 p. m. and were rebuffed by police officers when they tried to enter the Customs and Border Protection offices at the airport. Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington. His staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and they said we ll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner, Mr. Connolly said. I said that s not acceptable, he continued. We want to talk to the person in charge of operations at Dulles Airport. That s where the problem is, and that s where the federal judicial ruling is applicable. The clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to claw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned. The mayors of New York, Chicago and Boston spoke out, as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at Worth Airport. We have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart, he said. Chelsea Clinton joined a protest in New York. The order roiled relations with America s traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East. The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she is convinced that the resolute fight against terrorism does not justify blanket suspicion on grounds of origin or belief. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Saturday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey. But under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did not agree with this kind of approach. The matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries. In Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump s front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans. Shame, they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie Finding Dory. No hate, no fear, they added later. Refugees are welcome here. Security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from the inauguration prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill. Some Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country, Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. Some conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump s handling of the issue. We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families, said Brian Hooks, a chairman of the Kochs donor network. The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive. Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was poorly implemented and urged the president to make appropriate revisions. Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts. Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. They are sadly weak on immigration, he wrote. Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.",FAKE
25,MISLEADING MAINSTREAM MEDIA Is Pushing False Narrative That Trump Electors Could Steal Election From Him ¦Why It s Not Gonna Happen ¦And Why Their Attack On Our Democracy Is A Really BAD Idea,"Here is Michigan elector Michael Banerian telling about death threats that he s received over his vote for Trump on Monday.The leftist media has encouraged the (insanely impossible) idea that Trump could be defeated by the Electoral College, by using misleading headlines, like the one below from USA Today to help fuel the idea that Trump is not really that popular after all: The New York Times has shamelessly published several articles pushing the narrative that Trump could be ousted on December 19th when the electoral votes are cast for President:The Washington Post has also falsely promoted the idea that there was a real possibility Trump could be defeated on Monday:And finally, only two days ago, NBC News published this embarrassing piece on the possibility of an electoral coup on Monday, clearly written to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Trump s presidency:In a typical election year, the mid-December meeting of the electoral college interests only political junkies and civics teachers.Not this time.As the electors prepare to vote Monday, many say they have been besieged by phone calls and e-mails. One already resigned. Another said he won t vote as his state did. And electors in three states went to court seeking authority to vote as they please.Hillary Clinton s victory in the popular but not the electoral vote and uncertainty about Donald Trump have generated unusual interest in an event that is usually a political footnote.Members of the Electoral College will cast their historic votes for the next president of the United States on Monday. In the meantime, they are under siege.The nation s 538 presidential electors have been thrust into the political foreground like never before in American history. In the aftermath of a uniquely polarizing presidential contest, the once-anonymous electors are squarely in the spotlight, targeted by death threats, harassing phone calls and reams of hate mail. One Texas Republican elector said he s been bombarded with more than 200,000 emails. I never can imagine harassing people like this. It s just f up, said Jim Rhoades, a Republican elector from Michigan who runs a home inspection service. I ve lost a bunch of business. In recent decades, the Electoral College had become such a reliable rubber stamp of Election Day results that it was viewed as an afterthought.But with many Democrats desperate to block the all-but-certain ascension of Donald Trump to the White House, this long-neglected body has been gripped by turmoil, and its members have been subjected to pleas to upend centuries of tradition by casting their votes for someone other than the president-elect.There have been ad campaigns targeting electors and op-eds assailing their role. One Democratic member of Congress has called to delay the vote for president while an investigation of Russian involvement in the election is underway. Two others have pleaded with electors to consider Russia s role when deciding how to vote. Progressive groups are preparing protests across the country at sites where electors will meet to cast their ballots. Personal contact information for many electors has been posted publicly and it s been used to bury them with massive email campaigns.Chris Suprun of Texas, the only GOP elector to publicly oppose Trump, has been especially battered by criticism mainly from fellow Republicans, including party leaders who have questioned his integrity.Here is Tucker Carlson embarrassing Chris Suprun, as he attempts to explain why he won t vote for Trump: https://youtu.be/7oOhwHG2Gb4Suprun announced his intention to vote for someone other than Trump in a New York Times op-ed, recalling his service on Sept. 11, 2001, as a first responder to the attack on the Pentagon. On Friday, a Texas television station ran a story accusing Suprun of inventing his 9/11 role, the story that Suprun built his career around. The charge, based on a discrepancy with Suprun s LinkedIn page, featured an anonymous former colleague accusing Suprun of stolen valor. PoliticoEarlier this year, former deputy White House chief of staff Roy Neel published a whimsical piece of political fiction about faithless electors changing a presidential election outcome. In The Electors, an incumbent Republican president loses the popular vote and falls three electors short in the Electoral College as well. His devilish chief of staff hatches a plot that succeeds in turning two faithless electors against the Democratic candidate they were pledged but not required by law to support. Because a third turncoat has a massive heart attack before her vote is technically cast, the election goes to the House and the incumbent prevails.I have seen no particular evidence that the shadowy anti-Trump group trying to overturn the 2016 election with Electoral College defections was inspired by Neel s book. But it is so wildly unrealistic and potentially counterproductive that by comparison The Electors is a work of gritty realism.Technically, there are 21 states with 236 electoral votes (135 of them won by Trump) where laws do not require electors to vote for the popular-vote winner in that state. It is also theoretically possible that lawsuits being filed to strike down the coercive laws in the other 29 states (plus the District of Columbia) that sanction faithless electors could succeed, though there is no way they could succeed before the Electoral College casts its votes on December 19.The bigger problem is that interest in denying Trump the presidency through a campus riot in the Electoral College is pretty much limited to Democrats.The idea of Republican electors turning against Donald Trump found some traction back in the days when the mogul had nailed down the Republican presidential nomination over the violent objections of much of the GOP. It was the general-election equivalent of all the ultimately vain talk about a revolt of pledged Republican convention delegates determined to keep the demagogue away from the White House. Two Republican electors, one from Georgia and another from Texas, publicly expressed doubts they could bring themselves to cast votes for Trump (two Democratic electors expressed similar reluctance to vote for Hillary Clinton).Two things changed radically to re-consign the faithless elector scenario to the pages of fiction. First, of course, Donald Trump did not win the Electoral College vote by the two or three votes that might have made a very small group of renegades potential coup-makers. It would now take a defection of 37 electors to undo the deed of November 8. Beyond that, the Republican Party is no longer in open or even covert revolt against Donald Trump. In a process that began the moment he won the presidential nomination, the GOP has dutifully lined up in support of its president-elect. An awful lot of the anti-Trump sentiment Republicans exhibited earlier this year involved fears that he would lose badly and drag down the Republican-controlled Congress with him. Those fears are obviously moot today. No Republicans in Washington or in the states will offer cover to a faithless elector, much less 37 of them. It is so not happening.And so the plea made most conspicuously by Harvard law professor and political busybody Lawrence Lessig, that Republican electors rear up on their constitutional hind legs and award the presidency to Hillary Clinton as the popular vote winner, does not even pass the laugh test. Other members of the putsch cabal depart from Lessig by promoting a scenario whereby Trump-hating Republicans and Clinton-hating Democrats could join hands to elect somebody else entirely.And even if the moon turned blue and somehow a coup did happen, there is a fail-safe opportunity for Republicans when Congress meets to count and certify the Electoral College vote. Congress could choose to disregard the actions of faithless electors (with support from GOP officials in the affected states) and certify Trump as the winner. And if (and we are deep into science fiction at this point) the Electoral College does not clearly award anyone with 270 electoral votes, then the House would name Donald Trump president anyway.

26,Trump campaign manager charged with misdemeanor battery against reporter,"(Reuters) - Donald Trump s presidential campaign manager was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery in Florida on Tuesday in an incident involving a reporter, the latest chapter in a raucous U.S. race marked by threats, insults and physical confrontations. Police in Jupiter, Florida, charged Corey Lewandowski, 42, with intentionally grabbing and bruising the arm of Michelle Fields, then a reporter for the conservative news outlet Breitbart, when she tried to question Trump at a campaign event on March 8. Republican front-runner Trump repeatedly defended Lewandowski throughout a day of campaigning in Wisconsin. He also rescinded a previous pledge to support the Republican presidential nominee if it is not him. No, not anymore, he said when asked if he would honor his previous pledge. At a CNN town hall on Tuesday night, Trump said he would remain loyal to his campaign manager and that Lewandowski would remain on the job even though it might be more convenient on behalf of his campaign to terminate this man, ruin his life, ruin his family ... ruin his whole everything and say: ˜You re fired. Trump also questioned Fields original description of the incident in which she said she was almost yanked to the ground by Lewandowski. He wondered aloud if she had posed a threat to him because she approached him with an ink pen. She had a pen in her hand that could ve been a knife, Trump said. Police released a video of the incident showing Fields walking alongside Trump and trying to question him. Lewandowski is seen grabbing her arm and pulling her backward. Previous videos of the incident had been obscured by people in the crowd. At the time, Lewandowski called Fields delusional and said he never touched her. Campaign rallies for Trump, the billionaire businessman who leads the race to become the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election, are tumultuous at times and have been marked by occasional clashes between protesters and supporters or security personnel. His pugnacious campaign style, which includes personal insults directed at rivals and scathing criticism of protesters, has been criticized for encouraging physical altercations at his rallies. Trump leads rivals Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, and Ohio Governor John Kasich in opinion polls and in the number of delegates to the nominating convention, despite a concerted effort to stop him by a Republican establishment worried he will lead the party to defeat in November. Cruz said Trump of course should ask for Lewandowski s resignation. Look, it shouldn t be complicated that members of the campaign staff shouldn t be physically assaulting the press, Cruz said on the CNN town hall. Kasich said he considered such behavior totally and completely inappropriate. If it was me, if I was in this circumstance, I would take some sort of action, either suspension or firing, Kasich told reporters in Wisconsin. Cruz picked up the endorsement on Tuesday of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker ahead of the state s primary next week. Walker, who dropped out of the presidential race last year, called Cruz a principled constitutional conservative. I m all in, Walker said in an interview on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee, adding he was not endorsing Cruz in an attempt to stop Trump. I just fundamentally believe if you look at the facts, if you look at the numbers, that Ted Cruz is in the best position by far to both win the nomination of the Republican Party and to then go on and defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall this year, Walker said, referring to the Democratic front-runner. Walker joins a number of other more establishment Republicans who have backed Cruz as an alternative to Trump, who has racked up a strong delegate lead but alienated many party leaders with his harsh views on illegal immigration, Muslims and women. On his plane, Trump said Fields had been pursuing him after a news conference and Lewandowski was trying to get her off me. He questioned whether Lewandowski had given Fields the bruise on her arm. How do you know those bruises weren t there before? he asked reporters in Wisconsin. Republican strategist Katie Packer, who runs an anti-Trump Super PAC, said the incident and the charges against Lewandowski reflected the candidate s lack of respect toward women. He doesn t have the kind of values and the kind of temperament that we should expect from someone who wants to be commander in chief, she said. Lewandowski was charged with simple battery, defined under Florida law as intentionally touching or striking a person against their will. For a first offense, it is a misdemeanor in the first degree, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison or a fine of $1,000. A court date was set for May 4, according to the police report. Jupiter police said Lewandowski turned himself in, and he was issued a notice requiring him to appear in court and then released. He was not booked into the jail. Lewandowski s lawyer, Scott Richardson of West Palm Beach, Florida, declined to comment on whether his client would step down as campaign manager. Lewandowski will also be represented by Kendall Coffey, a Miami lawyer, the campaign said. Fields resigned from Breitbart less than a week after the incident, citing what she said was the online news outlet s refusal to stand behind her amid the allegations.",FAKE
27,WHY IS AL SHARPTON S Half-Brother Registering Thousands Of Felons To Vote In Alabama s Controversial Senate Race? [VIDEO],"Pastor Kenneth Sharpton Glasgow claims he s Reverend Al Sharpton s brother, and he s registering thousands of felons to vote in the hotly contested, upcoming Senate election. When the local News 5 station looked into the pastor s claim, that he was Al Sharpton s brother, they made an interesting discovery. Glasgow told News 5 that he was indeed Al Sharpton s brother and that he dropped the Sharpton because we didn t want somebody that s a racist, a bigot, to try to kill me knowing I was Sharpton s brother while he was in prison. News 5 performed a background check on Glasgow and came up with nothing. They also called Reverend Sharpton s office in New York and spoke with Sharpton s media correspondent, who said he d never heard of Kenneth Sharpton Glasgow. It wasn t until they contacted Sharpton-Glasgow s mother, Tina Glasgow, that they finally discovered the connection.As it turns out, Glasgow actually has ties to Al Sharpton Watch the video below for the bizarre details:Much like his brother, the pastor is also a Democrat activist, and he is pulling out all the stops to help the party defeat Judge Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama. While the Democrat Party is begging for donors to help support Moore s opponent, Doug Jones, Al Sharpton s half-brother is busy signing up felons to vote in a controversial election, where every vote will count.Thousands of felons across Alabama have registered to vote in recent weeks, according to Pastor Kenneth Glasgow, who is heading up a statewide effort to get felons to the voting booth.Glasgow s goal is to get as many felons as possible signed up to vote before the end of the day Monday, the deadline to be able to cast a ballot in Alabama s Dec. 12 U.S. Senate special election. In the last month, I think we registered at least five- to ten-thousand people all over the state, Glasgow, president of Dothan s The Ordinary People Society (TOPS) advocacy group, said Monday. I ve got people all over the state registering people with my TOPS branches in Tuscaloosa, Birmingham, Montgomery, Enterprise, Dothan, Abbeville, Geneva, Gordon, Bessemer, we have a lot. For generations, most Alabamians convicted of a felony were barred from ever voting in the state again, but the Definition of Moral Turpitude Act, a new law passed by the state Legislature and signed by Gov. Kay Ivey in May, cleared the way for thousands of felons to restore their voting rights.The law lists several dozen felony convictions that are considered crimes of moral turpitude, which means that anyone convicted of one of them loses the right to vote; other felons are now eligible to restore that right. Previously, the list of crimes that some registrars considered to be of moral turpitude was not clearly defined, and many felons simply believed they could never regain the franchise. AL",REAL
28,This Sheriff Has Threatened To Arrest The CEO Of Apple For Protecting Your Privacy (VIDEO),"Apple s fight against the FBI on behalf of the privacy rights of their customers has taken a chilling turn, with law enforcement officers openly threatening to arrest CEO Tim Cook personally if his company denies their requests.Grady Judd, Sheriff of Polk County Florida, issued a threat of arrest to Apple CEO Tim Cook during a press conference on Sunday. Asked how he would respond if Apple (or any other telecommunications company) ever declines a request to hack a phone on behalf of law enforcement agencies, Judd gave an angry response: I can tell you, the first time we do have trouble getting into a cellphone, we re going to seek a court order from Apple. And when they deny us, I m going to go lock the CEO of Apple up, he ranted. I ll lock the rascal up. Judd is not alone in attempting to apply this personal threat of arrest to the CEO simply for attempting to secure the privacy rights of his customers. As Newsweek reports:Judd s strong sentiments against encryption fall in line with those of other outspoken law enforcement officials in the United States. Many police departments and district attorney s offices have struggled with police investigations because of encrypted smartphones they cannot crack, Newsweek learned last month. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. testified before Congress regarding these frustrations alongside Apple s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, and FBI Director James Comey on March 1.Judd added: You cannot create a business model to go, We re not paying attention to the federal judge or the state judge. You see, we re above the law. The CEO of Apple needs to know he s not above the law, and neither is anybody else in the United States. Apple has stated that if they were to comply with the request of law enforcement, they would be creating a master key that would unlock any iPhone. Once created, this masterkey could then be used for nefarious reasons by law enforcement, government, criminal and terrorist organizations around the world.In an attempt to bully Apple into surrendering the privacy rights of their customers, senior officers in law enforcement, the security services, and even government, are applying pressure to Apple as a company, and the CEO Tim Cook personally.

29,"OBAMA S CROOKED DOJ HIDES Massive Hillary Scandal: The U.S. government spent millions of dollars, went all over the world to bankrupt him, and destroyed his life ” all to protect Hillary Clinton s crimes","The most crooked person to ever run for President The Obama administration is moving to dismiss charges against an arms dealer it had accused of selling weapons that were destined for Libyan rebels.Lawyers for the Justice Department on Monday filed a motion in federal court in Phoenix to drop the case against the arms dealer, an American named Marc Turi, whose lawyers also signed the motion.The deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi.Government lawyers were facing a Wednesday deadline to produce documents to Turi s legal team, and the trial was officially set to begin on Election Day, although it likely would have been delayed by protracted disputes about classified information in the case.A Turi associate asserted that the government dropped the case because the proceedings could have embarrassed Clinton and President Barack Obama by calling attention to the reported role of their administration in supplying weapons that fell into the hands of Islamic extremist militants. They don t want this stuff to come out because it will look really bad for Obama and Clinton just before the election, said the associate.In the dismissal motion, prosecutors say discovery rulings from U.S. District Court Judge David Campbell contributed to the decision to drop the case. The joint motion asks the judge to accept a confidential agreement to resolve the case through a civil settlement between the State Department and the arms broker. Our position from the outset has been that this case never should have been brought and we re glad it s over, said Jean-Jacques Cabou, a Perkins Coie partner serving as court-appointed defense counsel in the case. Mr Turi didn t break the law .We re very glad the charges are being dismissed. Under the deal, Turi admits no guilt in the transactions he participated in, but he agreed to refrain from U.S.-regulated arms dealing for four years. A $200,000 civil penalty will be waived if Turi abides by the agreement.A State Department official confirmed the outlines of the agreement. Mr. Turi cooperated with the Department s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls in its review and proposed administrative settlement of the alleged violations, said the official, who asked not be named. Based on a compliance review, DDTC alleged that Mr. Turi engaged in brokering activities for the proposed transfer of defense articles to Libya, a proscribed destination under [arms trade regulations,] despite the Department s denial of requests for the required prior approval of such activities. Turi adviser Robert Stryk of the government relations and consulting firm SPG accused the government of trying to scapegoat Turi to cover up Clinton s mishandling of Libya. The U.S. government spent millions of dollars, went all over the world to bankrupt him, and destroyed his life all to protect Hillary Clinton s crimes, he said, alluding to the deadly Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.Read more: Politico",REAL

31,Trump intelligence nominee supports probes on Russian interference,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump s nominee to be the director of national intelligence pledged on Tuesday to support thorough investigation of any Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, seeking to reassure lawmakers worried that partisan politics might interfere with a probe. I think this is something that needs to be investigated and addressed, former Republican Senator Dan Coats told the Senate Intelligence Committee during his confirmation hearing to be the top U.S. intelligence official. Coats, 73, a former member of the intelligence panel, also promised that it would have full access to all of the documents and other materials needed for an investigation. I have no intention of holding anything back from this committee, Coats said. Trump denounced intelligence agencies for their assessment that Russia sought to influence the election on his behalf, prompting concerns about his support for them. Trump has also repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, leading some in Washington worry that he might not take a hard enough line in dealings with Moscow. In his opening statement, Coats addressed that concern by listing activity by Russia, along with that of China and North Korea, as among the main challenges faced by the United States. Russia s assertiveness in global affairs is something I look upon with great concern, which we need to address with eyes wide open and a healthy degree of skepticism, Coats said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created after the Sept. 11 attacks to oversee all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies and improve communications among them. One concern about Coats was his record on the U.S. use after the 2001 attacks of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, which are widely seen as torture. In 2015, he was one of the few lawmakers who opposed legislation sponsored by Republican Senator John McCain that made the use of such techniques illegal. Coats promised that he would follow the law, saying he voted against that legislation because he wanted to at least have a discussion about the best way to proceed if intelligence agencies wanted to obtain crucial information quickly. Coats also strongly defended U.S. government surveillance programs, though he said he would do everything I can to publicly disclose an estimate of the number of Americans caught in the crosshairs of internet surveillance programs intended to target foreigners. But he stopped short of guaranteeing such a disclosure, which privacy advocates in Congress have requested for years and said is necessary to properly debate possible reforms to a surveillance law that expires at the end of 2017. Although he was ambassador to Germany under President George W. Bush, Coats would be the first director of national intelligence who has not spent most of his career in the military, in intelligence agencies or as a diplomat. Coats, who is popular with Democrats and his fellow Republicans, is expected to be easily confirmed.",FAKE
32,The Lighter Side of Rick Owens - The New York Times,"YOU KIND OF WANT the fashion designer Rick Owens to be a monosyllabic, misanthropic recluse. It s what the embodiment of his clothes should be, if we were going by some unwritten aesthetic script. After all, the fashion Owens presents four times a year, for men and women, on the grand Paris stage, isn t free and easy. It isn t simple. It often looks like rags: Precious fabrics, like cashmere, are pilled and laddered, and leather is repeatedly washed to give it the texture and appearance of a prehistoric animal s skin. There is something monstrous about his gothic garments, with their strange, disturbing proportions attenuated and exaggerated, draped like ectoplasm clinging to thin limbs. When people wear them head to toe, as Owens s most enthusiastic followers frequently do, they don t look human. They look other. Troll clothes for the most desperate lemmings in the fashion herd, one observer wrote in 2008 on The New York Times s On the Runway blog. Owens appreciated the sentiment so much that he ran the phrase on his website, alongside plaudits from the rest of the fashion world. There is, however, a disconnect between Rick Owens the man and Rick Owens the fashion designer. In photographs, Owens looks arresting, even sinister, with his black hair and shroudlike attire, like the Grim Reaper crossed with a West Coast surf bum. (He often wears shorts and sneakers, which undermines the goth undertones.) His spiky, sharply drawn features appear a little cadaverous. Presented in print, Owens ” generally quoted on topics such as death, renewal, creation ” can come across like a prophet of the apocalypse. And those monstrous troll clothes he designs often seem, at first glance, cold and hard, solid carapaces of fabric, sharply cut and difficult to wear. I miss archness, he murmurs, as if by way of explanation. I think there was an arch moment in the 40s in fashion, and I m thinking forward, thinking about fashion cycles ” that s kind of a good cycle to bring back. But there s something unexpectedly soft about Owens, both the man and his clothes. In person, he s preternaturally tanned (he holidays in the United Arab Emirates, the shortest flight to the most sun ) and his voice, a languid Californian drawl, redolent of the state where he lived until the age of 42, softens his doomsday portents. It adds both a humanity and a note of wry humor that collapses any perceived pretension. And in person, those clothes collapse too, in on themselves, softly wrapping the body in protective layers of felted fabric and down padding. Up close, his arch silhouettes prove light and pliable to the touch, seductive. In the middle of the last century, the couturier CristÃ³bal Balenciaga was first applauded, then deified by the fashion press for achieving the selfsame, and his approach influenced an entire generation of designers. Owens s technique has stealthily proved just as influential. Balenciaga probably didn t compare an especially visceral bunch of drapery to anal prolapse, as Owens has. But then he also, to my knowledge, didn t confess to an interviewer that he dyes his own hair. I m thinking I better shut up now, Owens says, almost as an aside. The delivery is so deadpan it begs for a punch line. Is it possible for designers to talk too much, do you think? He smiles, but thankfully doesn t stop talking. Owens is 55, and was born in Porterville, Calif. a small city in the San Joaquin Valley. He moved to Los Angeles after graduating high school, originally studying fine art at the Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design, then dropping out after two years. I wanted to be an artist at the beginning, he says. But then I didn t think I had it in me. I didn t think I had the intellectual stamina for it, so I decided to be a fashion designer, because that was frivolous and easy. Owens smiles wider. He is, again, deflating the myth that has grown around him. He doesn t take himself as seriously as his work would lead people to believe. Unlike many fashion designers, however, Owens is able to articulate, precisely and vividly, what he s trying to do with his clothes, namely talk about those big, overarching themes affecting humanity, and offer something different in the fashion landscape. When he talks, he makes you take him seriously. And he likes to talk. We meet in Paris to discuss his men s wear which, perhaps even more so than his women s wear, is revolutionary, and has proved groundbreaking in its influence. In a soupy sea of mediocre suiting and sportswear, he offers something entirely different from other designers. He boldly experiments with fabric and silhouette, pushing boundaries of sexuality and gender. Owens is as likely to propose a dress for a man as for a woman, but without sacrificing manliness in favor of runway novelty. My stuff seems to attract guys that I think might want to consider themselves some kind of heroic lone wolf, kind of playing by their own moral codes, Owens says, slowly. I was thinking about men s fashion, I was thinking in the 80s Calvin Klein, he promoted male sexuality . .. males as an object of sexual attention. That was what happened then, and then in the 90s men s fashion was a reaction to that and it became about youth. It became skinny and slim and young and introspective and vulnerable. Now, what is now? He stops. If the last cycle was vulnerability, the obvious reaction would be heroism. Heroism for Owens isn t about the jacket or pants. It isn t about any clichÃ© of dressing. Owens has created collections inspired by Nijinsky s performance in Afternoon of a Faun, and by the athletic silhouette of Fred Astaire. In both he used drapery instead of tailoring, garments twisted and captured in motion, seemingly frozen in frenzied, balletic movement. He also jokingly stated a collection was inspired by tops and bottoms ” not the garments, but rather the words denoting sexual preference in the gay vernacular. (Owens is bisexual.) For spring, Owens produced a remarkable collection, pumped with colors of putty pink, peppermint and sulfuric yellow. But it was the silhouette that made the strongest impact: jackets abbreviated high on the torso, pants billowing organically around the leg, like a fusion of languid 30s styles ” Owens loves that period ” and skater trousers. It seemed totally out of place at a moment when other men s wear designers showed either generic sportswear or predictably straight suiting. Owens isn t overtly interested in tailoring, the linchpin of the masculine wardrobe since the early 19th century. You seldom see anything approaching a suit jacket in his shows. I m not going to be [who] somebody trusts for tailoring over Dior, Owens says. Even one of my partners. For his wedding, he wore Dior! What he does offer is an alternative to the general thrust of fashion. And it s seductive. His business is relatively small. His turnover is approximately $140 million, paltry when compared to the luxury behemoths. But it s perfectly formed. My mantra for everybody is better, not bigger, he says. But it s hard. When there s a group of people together, they re thinking of the team, and you want to win. Sometimes commercial success is a little bit more tangible than aesthetic success. Yet for all those disparaging comments about fashion lemmings, and the hordes of devotees clustered outside Owens s shows in his most extreme looks, a core of his business comes from older, fashionable women and men, for whom a asymmetric Rick Owens jacket is the dernier cri of elegance. He also has a substantial celebrity following, although he doesn t care about things like that. He s often dubbed a cult designer. I hear the word cult used a lot, he admits. Which means you have a following, but you never hit the popular big time. But by his own estimation, Owens is not a cult designer. Like the Chanel jacket in the 50s, his leather biker jacket has become part of a uniform of our times. Pay attention, and you ll see it endlessly copied. Owens s output is prodigious. Alongside his men s and women s runway lines and their commercial offshoots, he creates two accessibly priced secondary lines: Lilies, a range of women s wear, and Drkshdw, a more unisex streetwear incarnation that began as a denim collection. He also has a fur line, Hunrickowens. (From 2003 to 2006, Owens was the creative director at the French furriers Revillon FrÃ¨res.) Owens designs nearly every facet of a contemporary wardrobe ” outerwear and sportswear, accessories and shoes. Or, rather, redesigns it. His sneakers, produced with Adidas and retailing for several hundred dollars a pair, don t look like other sneakers. With odd protrusions of rubber or leather, they resemble fossilized animal remains strapped to the body. His gloves sometimes have wings of leather, like dorsal fins. He also designs furniture. His dramatic pieces resemble great altars of Carrara marble or prehistoric slabs of petrified wood. A bed he designed looks like a sarcophagus crafted from alabaster, and weighs over a ton. Even Owens s toilets, in each of his three homes, look like chalices of marble. OWENS S FASHION EXPERIENCE began in the commercial world of Los Angeles. After dropping out of art school, he worked for a factory that copied designer clothing in shoddier fabrics. In 1994, he started his own line, selling directly to retailers. He didn t stage his first show in New York until 2002. A year later, he relocated to Paris. He still doesn t speak French, which he doesn t mind. I was just as isolated in Los Angeles as I am in Paris, he says. Owens is somewhat reclusive: He doesn t go out much, his life revolving around his home, the gym and a couple of nearby restaurants. He lives and works in a single building, the former headquarters of the French Socialist Party, on a grand square opposite the French parliament. The only windows in his studio overlook the quiet, deserted garden of the former Ministry of Defense. Here, his aesthetic is complete. The floors and many walls are raw concrete. Owens gutted the building when he moved in, but didn t do much else. Raw wires hang from the ceiling. I ve visited him here three times, in three different years. Eventually I understood I wasn t standing in the middle of a renovation. It was already complete. Owens lives with his wife of a decade, MichÃ¨le Lamy, who is a creative force behind many of Owens s endeavors. She codesigns a jewelry line with Loree Rodkin under the Owens umbrella named Hunrod (Hun is Owens s pet name for Lamy, combined with Rodkin s surname). She also collaborates with Owens on the design of his furs, and on his acclaimed furniture line, an exhibition of which is currently on view at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. She walks in halfway through our discussions, clad head to toe in Rick Owens. Her teeth glisten with gold, her fingers are tattooed and stained black. Together, they look remarkable ” fascinating and terrifying in equal measure. They seem perfectly at home in Owens s odd clothes among a grouping of their anthropomorphic spindly chairs that resemble something out of Beetlejuice. The furniture thing is really about completing . .. Owens stops, then continues: Of completely creating my own planet. Near Owens s studio window, a huge altarpiece of a table holds an arrangement of stone blocks, flowers and a skull. It looks eerily like a memento mori painting. He begins to talk about the darker themes within his work. His father, John, a former social worker, died in 2015, aged 95 ” which prompted a series of introspective, somewhat nihilistic collections. How do you face decline gracefully? he asks. I suppose it was because of Dad declining and me getting older and me thinking about how we face change and all of that. Ecological change, and political threat. Me thinking, Isn t all of this stuff maybe just supposed to happen? He shrugs. Our primal urge is to procreate. That s one of the reasons that we re on earth, our prime motivation is to procreate and to live forever. We re doing our best to do both, so isn t it inevitable that we just overcrowd it until something else happens? We just kill ourselves off? Something s got to evolve. These are seldom ideas connected to fashion nor ideas fashion designers willingly talk about. It s sociology and anthropology, he says. It s just the way ” that s what happens in real life. In real life, the act of creation is defying death. I think it s just that dumb and simple. Preamble aside, Owens isn t feeling particularly dour. It s early December, and he s planning his fall 2017 men s wear collection, which he ll show a month later in Paris. He named his previous two collections Mastodon and Walrus. They concentrated on the primordial, with thoughts about mankind going the way of the dinosaurs. This season the theme is Glitter. It s going to be about joyful abandon, he says. The show is inspired by glam rock, full of silhouettes with a theatrical bent, a hint of Bowie, possibly meeting Wagner, whose music Owens loves. There are lots of operatic trains. It doesn t contain sequins, or beading or, indeed, any glitter. Sequins in a collection called ˜Glitter, u2009 says Owens, making a face at such banality. He s saving the embellishment for his next collection, he says. It s going to be called Dirt. It was what can be as transgressive as possible for me, Owens says. Whenever I do anything transgressive, it s never out of anger or just provocation. There s usually something well intentioned, there s a spirit behind it. Owens pauses. He s worried he s talking too much again. It s just going to start getting corny, he reasons. But there is another side of me that s thinking not everybody reads those things. Not everybody is reading everything, so you should take every opportunity to put a positive message out whenever you can. Joy as transgression. It s a fitting summary of Owens s work, which, for all its subversion winds up feeling like a celebration of the power and energy of creativity. That Times comment on Owens s website, disparaging his output, closed with the refrain: A line needs to be drawn whereby credit is given to collections that deserve it. Too much talk is spent on too little. I d argue that is precisely why Owens warrants such consistent applause. His collections deserve to be talked about, by us, and by Owens himself. They ll be talked about by future generations, too, if Owens proves to be the CristÃ³bal Balenciaga of our time. Producing designs that defy fashion and challenge physics, turning the hard into soft, the cold into warm, blending masculine and feminine, he very well may be. I always think that the act of creation is your fight for immortality, Owens says. The energy of resisting death, and trying to be remembered in the best possible way. He says it lightly. Then he stops talking.",FAKE

34,IRRATIONAL GEORGETOWN PROFESSOR Has Month-Long Meltdown Over Fellow Muslim Professor Who Voted For Trump: F*CK You! [VIDEO],"A Georgetown University associate professor had a month-long meltdown after a Muslim woman explained why she voted for President-elect Donald Trump.Asra Q. Nomani, a former Georgetown journalism professor and Wall Street Journal reporter, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post Nov. 10 explaining why she, as a Muslim woman and long-time liberal, voted for Trump. I support the Democratic Party s position on abortion, same-sex marriage and climate change, Nomani wrote. But I am a single mother who can t afford health insurance under Obamacare. Here is a portion of Nomani s op-ed explaining why she s supporting Trump:A lot is being said now about the silent secret Trump supporters. This is my confession and explanation: I a 51-year-old, a Muslim, an immigrant woman of color am one of those silent voters for Donald Trump. And I m not a bigot, racist, chauvinist or white supremacist, as Trump voters are being called, nor part of some whitelash. In the winter of 2008, as a lifelong liberal and proud daughter of West Virginia, a state born on the correct side of history on slavery, I moved to historically conservative Virginia only because the state had helped elect Barack Obama as the first African American president of the United States.But, then, for much of this past year, I have kept my electoral preference secret: I was leaning toward Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Tuesday evening, just minutes before the polls closed at Forestville Elementary School in mostly Democratic Fairfax County, I slipped between the cardboard partitions in the polling booth, a pen balanced carefully between my fingers, to mark my ballot for president, coloring in the circle beside the names of Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence. WPJust prior to the election Nomani explains why she s voting for Trump:C. Christine Fair, a previously friendly colleague, went on a 31-day screed against Nomani spanning across Twitter and Facebook. According to Nomani s Dec. 23 follow-up complaint to the university, the Peace and Security Studies professor called her a wretch, clueless dolt and a fame-monger.Fair also compared Trump to Adolf Hitler and asserted that Nomani s vote for Trump helped normalize Nazis in DC. She didn t clarify if she was referring to Trump supporters or actual Nazis marching the streets.She again attacked Nomani Dec. 6 with an open letter on Facebook, in which Fair told her to f*ck off and GO TO HELL. It s unclear why Fair announces that she s a slut. Nomani told The Daily Caller News Foundation that Georgetown professor Bruce Hoffman replied to her original Dec. 2 complaint on Dec. 3. He told her he forwarded her complaint to professor Irfan Nooruddin. Nooruddin is the faculty chair of Georgetown s School of Foreign Service.Nooruddin told Nomani in a Dec. 4 email that, I shall follow up directly with Professor Fair. Fair posted her Facebook rant about Nomani two days after Nooruddin said he would speak with her. Additionally, she threatened Nomani in an email Dec. 6 with legal action. Your attempt to silence my opinion or force a dialogue by involving my employer is unacceptable and any further action on your part to involve Georgetown will be met with legal action, Fair wrote. Your social media and email appeal to my employer with the intent or threat of damaging my employment status is a form of cyber bullying, which will not be tolerated. Daily Caller",REAL
35,Donald Trump Was Looking To Build A Trump Tower In Moscow While He Was Running For President,"As you would be more than aware, contacts between high-ranking and lower-level Trump aides and Russians have emerged in recent months and, as a result of these talks, a new story is coming to light; that Donald Trump s businesses were trying to seal a deal on building an enormous Trump Tower in Moscow while he was campaigning to become President of the United States.According to those familiar with the proposal, as well as new records reviewed by Trump Organization lawyers, Felix Sater, a Russian-born real estate developer who migrated to Brooklyn at the age of six, was essentially begging Trump to fly to Russia to promote the idea for the Tower and also claimed he could get President Vladimir Putin to say great things about Trump, all while he was still campaigning to be Commander in Chief in late 2015 and early 2016.Sater took it to another level when he predicted in an email sent to Trump Organization Executive Vice President Michael Cohen in November 2015, that Trump and his organization would be celebrating both his Presidential win and one of the biggest residential projects in the history of real estate. According to one of the few people briefed on the email exchange, Sater s message to Cohen was something to the effect of, Can you believe two guys from Brooklyn are going to elect a president? The plan for the Moscow Trump Tower was abandoned at the end of January last year, just before the beginning of the presidential primaries and before Trump s Russian business ties became a major issue, because, although the Trump Organization signed a letter of intent to go ahead with the project despite Trump himself not making the proposed trip to Russia, they lacked the land permits to proceed.The details of the Moscow Trump Tower have deal have never been made public, however, the emails are scheduled to be turned over to congressional investigators soon and all signs point to this being far from President Trump s only business dealing with Russia during his time on the campaign trail. White House officials, as well as Cohen, Trump s longtime legal advisor, have declined to comment on the issue.Featured image via Michael Reynolds Pool/Getty Images",REAL
36,Tokyo Governor Koike to challenge Japanese PM Abe with new party,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike on Monday said she will lead a new national party that will challenge Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a general election expected to be called for next month. Koike, who named her new political group the Party of Hope, has emerged as a serious threat to Abe after she won the Tokyo governorship a year ago and in July fielded candidates who routed the LDP in elections for the metropolitan assembly. I want the Japanese people to believe that there is hope for tomorrow, she said at a televised press conference. Our ideal is to proceed free of special interests, she added. Koike is an ex-defense minister and former LDP member, and the challenge to her old party could pose a greater risk for Abe, who is expected to call a snap election for next month. Abe is benefiting from improved ratings and opposition disarray, but should he suffer a big loss of seats it could spur a challenge to his leadership from within the LDP. A weekend survey by the Nikkei business daily showed 44 percent of voters will back Abe s LDP with only 8 percent supporting the main opposition Democratic Party.",FAKE
37,2016: Remains of 61 Dead Migrants Recovered in One Texas County,"As the year end closed out in one Texas county, the remains of human smuggling victims had been recovered in what has become known as the Brooks County killing fields. [Brooks County is not a border county. In fact, it is located about 80 miles north of the border. Yet it is the focus of human smuggling activity in South Texas that often leads to death for many of those who have paid for illegal transportation around a Border Patrol checkpoint. The Border Patrol checkpoint is located right in the middle of our county, newly Sheriff Benny Martinez told Breitbart Texas Sunday morning. There is no way to move through the county for these human smugglers other than to attempt to sneak their human cargo through the checkpoint, or march them around the checkpoint and through the dangerous ranch lands in the county. This is where the deaths occur. Martinez told Breitbart Texas his county has recovered the bodies or remains of 61 people in 2016. This happens because the human smugglers have no regard for human life, Martinez said. They will simply abandon anyone who cannot keep up with the group ” leaving them to die from heat exhaustion, dehydration, or exposure to the elements. Breitbart Texas has accompanied Sheriff Martinez and other Brooks County deputies to the scene of body recoveries in the past. The rotting bodies and picked apart bones tell a tragic story of what must have been a horrifying and excruciating death for these people who paid as much as $6, 000 to human smugglers to get them safely to their destination. The treatment of these illegal immigrants by their human smugglers is horrific, Sheriff Martinez told Breitbart Texas in June 2016. The people they take on these marches around the checkpoint are for the heat and hazardous terrain of these ranches. When they can t keep up, they are left behind where they will die quickly if they don t get help. The county, already strapped for cash, must deal with the cost of processing the remains and burial of the bodies. This can cost the county taxpayers up to $2, 000 per body, Breitbart Texas previously reported. Martinez is responsible for patrolling an area about the size of Rhode Island with a handful of vastly underpaid deputies. Communications capabilities are sketchy in many areas of the county where cell phones and police radios won t work because of the lack of equipment. We need help in establishing better communications for our deputies, Martinez said. It is important for officer safety, but it is also important when deputies come across someone in need of assistance. The migrants will frequently walk out of the fields and into the roadway after days of wandering lost in the fields. Many need help right away. Martinez said thing may soon get worse as the Border Patrol is expanding the checkpoint to eight lanes. They are creating a smuggling superhighway right in the middle of our county, Martinez expressed. This could create even more pressure on our resources as more smuggling vehicles make their way north from the border. The new sheriff said they have seen an increase in traffic through the ranches. Increased presence from Border Patrol search and rescue teams, Texas Department of Public Safety troopers, and Texas State Guard search teams have helped keep the numbers of deaths down. Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on the rescues of migrants who have been abandoned and left to die by the ruthless smugglers in the area. Border Patrol agents rescued an illegal immigrant woman trying to bypass a checkpoint in Brooks County in November, Breitbart Texas reported. She was found unconscious after being abandoned by human smugglers. In April, two teenage girls were rescued from a ranch in Brooks County after being abandoned. One of the girls, a Mexican national, was found unconscious and clinging to life. She had to be transported by helicopter to a Corpus Christi hospital. These heartless criminals take ruthless steps to exploit the multitude of poor immigrants from Mexico and Central America trying to reach the United States at any cost and the problem is getting worse, Chief Patrol Agent Manuel Padilla, Jr. said at the time in a written statement. No one wants to see their loved ones being violated or abandoned in this manner. Death is not the only risk to the migrants being smuggled through Brooks County. Breitbart Texas previously reported, about the specific kinds of horror faced by these illegal immigrants because of the open border policies of the federal government. Rape, abuse, abandonment and death are often the treatment these people receive from their human smugglers who are often connected to Mexican cartels. Now the task of stopping the human smugglers and ending the needless deaths of illegal immigrants in this South Texas county fall on Sheriff Martinez. We appreciate the help with get from other agencies and from the volunteer police officers who give their time to help patrol our county, Martinez said. We have limited resources, but we will continue to push to stop the human smugglers and to find the lost migrants before they succumb to the elements.

38,Donald Trump Jr. Blames Scalise Shooting On ˜Caesar Actors And Gets WRECKED (TWEETS),"If Republicans were even moderately literate, they would know that the message of Shakespeare s Julius Caesar is that assassinating leaders you don t like is just bad juju all around. Everyone ends up unhappy in the end. Enter Donald Trump Jr, stage far-Right.Shortly after the guy who shot GOP Rep. Steve Scalise and four other people at baseball practice was revealed to be a Green Party person who voted for Jill Stein, regularly bashed Hillary Clinton, and who happened to volunteer for Bernie Sanders campaign, Donald Trump Jr. hopped on Twitter to blame a bunch of actors. Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President, the tweet reads. It is, of course, referencing the Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar. Traditionally, the play has featured various world leaders, including Abraham Lincoln, in the role of Caesar. In 2013, for example, the very same play with the very same script featured a man who looked strikingly similar to Barack Obama. He was murdered, because the play s plot largely hinges on the historical fact that Julius Caesar was murdered. Here is a photo of the 2013 Caesar:Conservatives said nothing at the time because it was Barack Obama, but when Donald Trump the current President* was Caesar, all hell broke loose because Republicans, as a group, are f*cking morons.Fortunately, the fine folks on Twitter were kind enough to let him know that he s too stupid to know he s stupid:The point of the play is that political violence is wrong.That s like saying we shouldn t watch Saving Private Ryan or it ll lead to war.

39,Trump Staffers Admit Their Boss Has No Idea What DACA Is,"Donald Trump sent a racist elf to make the announcement that his administration is going to punish 800,000 young people, who came to the U.S. as children, and subject them to deportation in an act that Attorney General Jeff Sessions called compassionate. The Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, is being terminated by a man who doesn t know what the program is, according to Trump s own administration officials, who said he doesn t fully comprehend what the move to eliminate DACA would mean.According to the New York Times, it was just an hour before the announcement that Trump administration officials privately expressed concern that the former reality show star might not fully grasp the details of the steps he was about to take, and when he discovered their full impact, would change his mind.Trump did not have the courage to face the nation and make the announcement himself and left Sessions to do his dirty work.The perpetrators behind pushing Trump to eliminate the program include Stephen Miller the amateur president s chief domestic policy aide who wrote the Trump campaign s immigration plan promising the termination of DACA, and has played a pivotal role inside the White House in pushing Trump to roll back the provision, according to Politico.Steve Bannon and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the latter of which just made the announcement, have also been against the program, even though ending it would hurt the economy.Trump, without even comprehending how upending the program would affect the economy as well as tear families apart, allowed three extremists to call the shots instead of trying to unify the country while it was just besieged by one deadly hurricane and another category 5 storm is on its way.Bannon and Sessions both believe that Trump s rise is credited to his stance on immigration, however, the former reality show star told DREAMers recently to rest easy because his administration would not kick them out of the country. Just a few days ago, Trump said, We love the DREAMers! Photo by Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",REAL

In a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Trump said he would side with Israel, a close U.S. ally, in any negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable, he said. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel and they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish State, Trump told the pro-Israel lobbying group.

42,Donald Trump Just Posted A BRUTAL Video That Shows How Much Everyone Hates Ted Cruz (VIDEO),"Maybe this is Republican front-runner Donald Trump s strange way of celebrating April Fool s Day or maybe he s just being his normal, childish self, but The Donald has just posted a pretty hilarious video that boasts the fact that his GOP rival, Texas senator Ted Cruz, is highly unlikable.Cruz s unpopularity amongst not only the general public, but his Republican colleagues as well, has been widely reported on during this campaign. So much so, that there was even an analysis done on the offensiveness of Cruz s face! Trump is using this to his full advantage in his new Instagram video, which is so creatively entitled Nobody Likes Ted The short video goes through several instances where Cruz s peers have insulted and spoken about how much they dislike him. Testimonials from Cruz s former college roommate Craig Mazin, old bosses like Bill O Reilly and fellow senators all get their fair share of the spotlight in footage that will surely take Cruz s ego down several notches.Mazin s appearance in the video was no surprise he s spoken openly about his disdain for Cruz several times before. However, former Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole is an interesting addition, as he suggests he might oversleep on election day if Cruz is nominated. Senator Lindsey Graham, who chose to endorse Cruz s campaign over Trump s, has previously made it perfectly clear that his endorsement in no way means that he likes Cruz, and that he believes the Texas senator is just as bad as President Barack Obama, if not worse. Another hilarious part features Bill O Reilly telling Cruz that former President George W. Bush doesn t like him!

43,Sessions visits U.S.-Mexico border to push migrant crackdown,"Nogales, Ariz. (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Tuesday to make his case for increased prosecutions of illegal immigrants, pressuring U.S. attorneys to prioritize cases against criminal migrants. Sessions, a long-time proponent of tougher immigration enforcement, told U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at the Port of Nogales, Arizona, that more illegal migrants should be prosecuted as criminals. It is normally the role of the Secretary of Homeland Security to meet border agents. But Sessions made the visit to highlight his focus on enforcing federal laws as dozens of U.S. cities try to shield illegal immigrants from stepped-up prosecution and deportation efforts. Why are we doing this? the former U.S. senator said. Because it is what the duly enacted laws of the United States require. Sessions said that each U.S. attorney would be required to designate a point person on border security prosecutions by April 18. The person in that position, known as a border security coordinator, would be directed to coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, according to Sessions memo. The directive did not go beyond existing laws, but Sessions said his order mandates the prioritizations of such enforcement by U.S. attorneys. The Trump administration has threatened to cut off U.S. Justice Department grants to so-called sanctuary cities that fail to assist federal immigration authorities. Police in such cities have argued that targeting illegal migrants is an improper use of law enforcement resources. Sessions has said a failure to deport aliens convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk. Under U.S. law, anyone who harbors or transports an undocumented immigrant, has crossed the border illegally two or more times, resists an immigration officer s arrest or commits travel document fraud is subject to criminal prosecution. Other immigrants apprehended for crossing the border illegally face civil procedures, with deportation the only penalty. Sessions announcement was the latest move by the Trump administration to deter illegal immigration. President Donald Trump has also called for not releasing migrants with pending court cases, targeting more people in immigration raids and building a wall on the southwest border. Speaking just 50 yards from a border fence on the Arizona-Mexico border, Sessions said that adding more fencing to the border will be a force multiplier against illegal migration. He also said the Justice Department plans to add 50 more immigration judges in 2017 and 75 more in 2018. Immigration judges oversee civil immigration cases, but there is a backlog of over 540,000 pending cases due a shortage of judges.",FAKE
44,"On climate change, ideological and partisan polarization hardens","Later this week, Pope Francis will reportedly make a moral case for combating climate change, arguing that it is mostly a problem created by humans and that we must make fundamental lifestyle and energy consumption changes to reverse course ” on behalf of the world s poor, but also on behalf of all of us. This, among other factors, could help push climate change on to the national political agenda, giving it more relevance to this cycle than it has enjoyed in previous years.

But if anything, the partisan and ideological divide over global warming is as wide as ever, and perhaps is getting worse.

That s what a new Pew poll indicates. The Pew poll finds that worry about global warming is on the rise: Some 69 percent of Americans now say it is a very or somewhat serious problem. However, Pew also finds: views about the significance of global warming as a problem continue to diverge. 

The Pew poll finds that 68 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming. But the partisan divide is stark: 86 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents say there is evidence of it, while Republicans are split, 45-48, on the question.

That s driven (not surprisingly) by conservative Republicans, the only ideological group that says there s no solid evidence of climate change ” and when you get deeper into the partisan and ideological breakdown, the differences get more stark:

Today, roughly nine-in-ten liberal Democrats (92%) say that there is solid evidence the earth s average temperature is rising, and 76% attribute this rise mostly to human activity. Very few liberal Democrats (5%) say there is not solid evidence of warming. A clear 83% majority of conservative and moderate Democrats also say the Earth is warming, but just 55% say this is the result of human activity. By contrast, just 38% of conservative Republicans say that there is solid evidence of global warming. Reflecting a divide within the GOP, conservative Republicans stand out as the only ideological group in which a majority (56%) says that there is not solid evidence of a rise in the earth s temperature (a 61% majority of moderate and liberal Republicans say the earth is warming).

Meanwhile, as David Leonardt notes, skepticism about global warming is running high among GOP voter groups, such as older voters, whites, men, and white evangelicals.

While there are reasons to doubt that Hillary Clinton will be quite the climate hawk that some advocates hope for, in her Saturday kick-off speech she leaned harder than expected into arguments for robust action to combat climate change and transition towards a clean energy economy and future. It s often said that climate is not a motivating issue for voters, and it s true that Democrats and advocates have not cracked this problem yet. That said, whatever the impact on the electoral outcome, it s still plausible that climate will have a significantly higher profile this cycle than it has in previous ones.

It s not just that Clinton appeared to signal that she will campaign on climate, as part of a broader bet on the Obama coalition of millennials, non-whites, and socially liberal college educated whites. It s also a confluence of other factors: The Obama administration will roll out new EPA rules for existing power plans this summer, and the court battles over them will intensify. Meanwhile, President Obama will be trying to negotiate a global climate deal later this year in Paris. All indications are he ll be talking about the issue more and more, as a key piece of his legacy. These developments may coincide with the intensifying GOP presidential primary, in which the candidates will all be showcasing the zeal with which they d roll back Obama s agenda ” the climate piece included.

All of which seems likely to only make polarization around climate change worse. No matter what Pope Francis has to say about it.

UPDATE: I should also have noted that the Pew poll finds that worry about global warming is on the rise: Some 69 percent of Americans say it is a very or somewhat serious problem. I ve edited the above to add that.",FAKE
45,9 in 10 Gang Rapists In Sweden Have Foreign Origins,"A new report suggests that in cases of gang rape or sexual assaults involving two or more attackers in Sweden, 85 percent of the attackers come from a foreign origin. [The information comes from a Swedish website Gang Rape Sweden which has kept tabs on the various instances of group rape that have occurred in the country over a period from 2011 to 2015. The site lists the various rapists names, case numbers, and other details which show the national origins, if known, of the attackers. According to the site, All records and documents available on this website are Swedish public records. The site claims that in total between 2011 and 2015 there were 125 individuals accused and convicted of participating in group sex attacks. The majority, 41, come from unknown countries outside of Sweden, and they are followed by 23 from Afghanistan and 20 from Sweden itself. The total number of amounts to 105 or around 85 percent. The site makes a distinction of those accused of true gang rape (participating in sex acts) and those tried along with a rapist for other crimes like failure to disclose the sex attack. Of the true gang rapes, they measure 50 such cases. Details are also given on the site as to the nature of the accusations, with thirteen of the gang rapists accused of having sex with underage children. Among those accused of molesting minors, none of the suspects are Swedish. The longest sentence for rape occurred in the case of Bardiya Coen Pajouhi, who comes from an unknown country and received a sentence for aggravated rape, though it says he will not be deported to his country of origin. Among those convicted of raping a child, many of the attackers were underage themselves, which matches previous reports of young boys and girls being raped in or around asylum accommodations. In one particular attack, a group of boys from Afghanistan took another young asylum seeker into a wooded area in Uppsala where they beat and raped him, filming the attack on their mobile phones. The Afghani migrants who raped the boy, who is said to have been under the age of 15, were tried and found guilty, but will not be deported back to Afghanistan because Swedish courts have deemed the country too dangerous for them to return to. In the statistics provided by the site, only 30 of those convicted face deportation, as opposed to 73 who will not be sent back to their countries of origin, more than double. The Swedish government refuses to keep official statistics that track the origin of criminals and have not done so in over a decade. One police officer, Peter Springare, blew the whistle on migrant crime back in February of this year, claiming that almost all of the serious criminal activity in Sweden is committed by foreigners and migrants.

46,Can Kenya lead the African Union?,"Tweet Widget by Horace G. Campbell 
From championing impunity for suspected masterminds of crimes against humanity, to frustrating African liberation and unity by working in cahoots with Empire; from publicly supporting Israel's desire to join the African Union, to being a conduit for illicit financial flows from Africa; Kenya is fundamentally unfit to lead the AU. A deeply entrenched kleptocracy has ruined Kenya and actively undermined African interests for over half a century. Can Kenya lead the African Union? by Horace G. Campbell 
This article previously appeared in Pambazuka News . 
At every step of the way since 1963, Kenya worked against African independence. 
Introduction 
The African Union will choose a new Chair of the AU Commission in January 2017. There are six candidates for this position, viz. Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi of Botswana, Farki Mahamat of Chad, Agapito Mba Mokuy of Equatorial Guinea, Amina Mohamed of Kenya, Abdoulaye Bathily of Senegal and Jakaya Kikwette of Tanzania. The post of Commission Chair became vacant after the expiration of the term of South Africa s Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who had been at the helm since 2012 and did not apply for a second term. 
At the last AU meeting held in July in Kigali, the election was suspended because, after seven rounds of voting, none of the top three contenders from Botswana, Equatorial Guinea and Uganda obtained the required two-thirds majority. Since the suspension of the process, Specioza Wandira Kazibwe of Uganda dropped out and three new candidates have appeared. Kenya has offered the Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs to lead the African Union. The government of Kenya has embarked on a multimillion-dollar diplomatic offensive to persuade Africans that Kenya should lead the African Union. Should Kenya lead the African Union? 
Let s begin this analysis by going back 53 years ago. At the dawn of independence in 1963, the political leaders in Kenya under Jomo Kenyatta and Oginga Odinga had agreed that, after independence, all British troops would leave Kenya. A few weeks after independence in December 1963, the so-called Shifta rebellion began and the political leaders of Kenya requested Britain to maintain their armed personnel in Kenya to assist in crushing the rebellion. The British troops have remained in Kenya since then. 
Was Britain instrumental in fomenting this Somali question within Kenya? This and related questions have become pertinent as the records of the British are open and we know of the findings of the Northern Frontier District (NFD) Commission along with the debates within Britain over the future of Somalia. Fifty-three years later, Somali descendants who live in Kenya are still being used as political football as Kenya has vowed to close the largest refugee camp in the world, the Dadaab, that hosts mostly Somali refugees following the collapse of their state in 1991. 
Kenya is fighting the so-called war on terror in Somalia and there are credible reports that this has been a very lucrative business venture for sections of the financial and sugar barons in Kenya. 
Kenya had been used as a base to foil genuine support for decolonization, and since the so called ˜War on Terror Kenya has been serving as an ally of the US. 
It is this section of the barons that leads Kenya that has now put forward the name of Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed to be the next head of the AU Commission. It is in this context of the lobbying by the Kenyan government that this author wants to put forward a number of reasons why Kenya cannot lead the African Union. 
The political leadership of Kenya since President Jomo Kenyatta, Daniel Arap Moi, Mwai Kibaki and now Uhuru Kenyatta has been servants of imperial intrigue and skullduggery to undermine African independence and Unity. Kenya had been used as a base to foil genuine support for decolonization, and since the so called ˜War on Terror Kenya has been serving as an ally of the US providing the political support for the US Africa Command and activities of the West in the Indian Ocean region. 
For a short while when the questions of the killings with impunity suggested the possibility of international justice, the present Kenyan leadership of Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto (both indicted for crimes against humanity) embarked on an overheated campaign to represent themselves as African nationalists opposed to imperial machinations of the International Criminal Court. Kenyan diplomats, with Amina Mohamed in the vanguard, led a diplomatic offensive against the ICC and since the charges have been dropped against President Kenyatta and Ruto, the leadership has been going on overdrive to harness international support for the accumulation of prowess of the barons in Kenya. 
These political forces hosted President Barack Obama for a global entrepreneurship conference in August, 2015, followed by Pope Francis s visit in November. Kenya hosted the 10 th Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade Organization in December 2015 and in 2016 hosted the meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). These latter meetings set back the agenda of Africans who had been struggling within the WTO for the rich countries to accede to the DOHA development round. While scuttling the African agenda in the WTO and without notice withdrawing its peacekeeping forces from South Sudan, the Kenyan leadership is asking Africans to support Amina Mohammed for the top position as AU Commissioner. 
In light of the aggressive diplomatic forces of the Moroccan leadership to reverse the position of the African Union on the independence of Western Sahara, it will be important for progressive forces within the Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) to raise their voices about the present diplomatic campaign of not only Kenya, but also the other countries, Botswana, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, and Senegal who have fielded candidates for the position of AU Commissioner. Below we detail the number of reasons for opposing the leadership of Kenya at this historical moment. 
Illicit financial flows from Eastern Africa 
The number one reason why Kenya cannot lead the African Union is that Kenya has been a base for illicit financial flows out of Eastern Africa. Most of the fraudsters that steal from their societies have a base in the real estate and financial sectors of Kenyan society. Two years ago the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) estimated that economies of Africa lost approximately US$1Trillion and about US $50 billion per year from illicit financial flows. The Report of the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa drew attention to the varying forms of fraud that had been employed to export capital from Africa, noting that, 
Some of the effects of illicit financial outflows are the draining of foreign exchange reserves, reduced tax collection, cancelling out of investment inflows and a worsening of poverty. Such outflows which also undermine the rule of law, stifle trade and worsen macroeconomic conditions are facilitated by some 60 international tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions that enable the creating and operating of millions of disguised corporations, shell companies, anonymous trust accounts, and fake charitable foundations. Other techniques used include money laundering and transfer pricing. 
This High Level Report went on to highlight the role of Kenya in illicit financial flows out of Africa: Kenya is believed to have lost as much as $1.51 billion between 2002 and 2011 to trade misinvoicing. The role of IFFs and their adverse effect on the country s GDP cannot be ignored. A recent study shows that Kenya s tax loss from trade misinvoicing by multinational corporations and other parties could be as high as 8.3 per cent of government revenue, hampering economic growth and resulting in billions in lost tax revenue. 
It does not take rocket science to grasp the fact that all of the malfeasance of disguised corporations, shell companies, anonymous trust accounts, fake charitable foundations, money laundering and transfer pricing are present in Kenya. From the period of 1960 and the gold scandals from Eastern Congo, Nairobi has been the base for money laundering in Eastern Africa. Illicit funds from the Eastern DRC, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, Southern Sudan and Somalia all pass through the money laundering facilities of Kenya. Other illicit money grabbers from as far afield as Nigeria use the recourses and networks of the Kenya financial barons; the real estate boom in Kenya in the past fifteen years is directly linked to these fraudulent funds being laundered in Kenya. 
From the period of 1960 and the gold scandals from Eastern Congo, Nairobi has been the base for money laundering in Eastern Africa. 
Most recently, there was a report on the nexus of corruption and conflict in the Sudan, which brought out revealing figures on the extent of the real estate holdings in Nairobi and of the top officials of the South Sudanese state. Entitled War Crimes Shouldn't Pay [2] , the report found that ""top officials ultimately responsible for mass atrocities in South Sudan have at the same time managed to accumulate fortunes, despite modest government salaries"". 
Kenyan bureaucrats and financiers have been implicated in the top four ways of draining valuable resources out of South Sudan: (a) extractive services, (b) the military state (c) state spending and (d) money laundering. 
Questions on the complicity of Kenya in the debacle of the struggles between differing factions in South Sudan increased after Kenya decided to pull its troops out of South Sudan after the Secretary General of the United Nations sacked the Kenyan commander of the UN peacekeeping forces in South Sudan. 
When the High Level Panel outlined the extent of illicit financial flows out of Africa, they had given clear recommendations as to how to stop these forms of drainage out of Africa. The Panel called for member states of the African Union to inter alia: (a) Determine the nature and patterns of illicit financial outflows from Africa; (b) Raise awareness among African governments, citizens and international development partners of the scale and effect of such financial outflows on development; and (c) Propose policies and mobilize support for practices that would reverse such illicit financial outflows. 
It is the expectation of millions of the working poor in Africa that their representatives at the African Union would be at the forefront of calling for the return of stolen assets to African societies. One would have expected that because Kenya has been so prominent in the business of money laundering, the loudest calls for ending these forms of capital accumulation would come from inside the society. However, as one component of the disorientation of activists, the NGO mentality predisposes many to seek solutions from donor agencies without understanding that these so called donors form an essential link in the chain of draining resources out of Africa. 
Instead of robust voices exposing the role of Kenya in money laundering, the Kenyan political leadership has invested millions of dollars to send Vice President William Ruto on a spirited tour proclaiming the candidature of Amina Mohammed. On these trips to other African countries, Ruto has been proclaiming the virtues of Kenya as a base for trade and investment. 
War on terror as a business in Kenya 
The second reason for objecting to the bid for Kenya to take over the position as AU Commissioner relates to the role of Kenya in Somalia and the fact that the so-called Operation Linda Nchi has for all intents and purposes been a business venture by the sugar and military barons of Kenya. The African Union had committed its reputation on the future of peace in supporting African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). However, Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia have played geo-political games with the lives of the people of Somalia and there is credible evidence that this Kenyan mission has been using the peacekeeping mission as a business venture. For years the United Nations Monitoring Group for Somalia has been reporting on the scale of the involvement of AMISOM troops in the sale of charcoal and sugar using the port of Kismayo under the control of AMISOM. 
When progressive forces in Eastern Africa did not take up the issue vigorously, a group named Journalists for Justice documented the reality that elements from the Kenyan army have been involved in a US$400 million sugar smuggling racket in Somalia and have also funded militants that they were supposed to be fighting. Far from fighting the Al Shabaab, the Kenyan Defense Forces (KDF) are in garrison mode sitting in bases while senior commanders are engaged in corrupt business practices. This report [3] on Kenya s Criminal Racket in Somalia has produced enough evidence to corroborate the information that has been produced for nearly a decade about how war is a business in Somalia. 
Progressives have shirked from quoting from the reports of this organization in so far as the organizations also seek to use information on KDF involvement in racketeering in supporting the voices of those calling for the disbanding of the African Union. 
Layering and the barons of Kenya 
Apart from investigative journalists who have been documenting the war business in Somalia very few scholars have actually interrogated how the global war on terror feeds into the illicit global economy. It has been estimated by the World Economic Forum that the international illicit economy is valued at over US $3.8. trillion. This means that in terms of GDP, the illicit economy is among the top 10 economies in the world. It is in this global illicit economy where one finds the layering of barons with the financial barons at the top of the food chain. Next to the financial barons are the real estate barons, the land grabbers/barons, the sugar barons involved in smuggling and illegality, the drug barons “ (see cases of cocaine smuggled as sugar), education and business of procurement, barons in hospitals and medicine “ (see the Constant Gardner and Kenya as a place for fake drugs), military and security barons “ war on terror as a business venture “ ethnic and regional power brokers, political fixers and counterfeiting barons. 
If we do not fight the cartels, we become their slaves. 
These barons form the base for the Kenyan capitalist class and they have an agreement among themselves to divide the working peoples of Kenya on the basis of ethnicity, regionalism and religion. In the particular case of Kenya, there is public knowledge of the criminality of the cartels with the former Chief Justice Dr. Willy Mutunga raising questions of how these barons and cartels pose a threat to the wellbeing and security of the peoples of Kenya and East Africa. He had noted that, The influence of the cartels is overwhelming. They are doing illegal business with politicians. If we do not fight the cartels, we become their slaves. But leaders who do take on the cartels must be prepared to be killed or exiled. 
The statement of the Chief Justice provides the context for better understanding the spate of killings that have been labeled as terror attacks since the Kenyan Defense Forces invaded Somalia in 2011. A series of high profile incidents such as the Al-Shabaab siege of the Westgate shopping center in Nairobi that left 67 people dead, ensured that there was international support for counter-terrorism in Kenya. This was followed by the killing of approximately 68 people in Mpeketoni, Majembeni and Poromoko at the coast in June 2014; the killing of 28 people in a bus in Mandera in November 2014; the killing of 36 people in a Mandera quarry in December 2014; and the killing of 147 students on the campus of Garissa University College in April 2015. It is these kinds of killing with impunity that disqualify Kenya fundamentally since the aggressive stand on the ICC was not accompanied by an equally aggressive stand to pursue the perpetrators of the post-election killings in Kenya in 2008. 
Kenya undermining the African cause at the WTO 
One of the supposed strong points of Amina Mohamed was her leadership of Kenya at the 10 th Ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization in December 2015. Prior to the WTO meeting in Seattle in 1999, Kenyan intellectuals had been at the forefront of challenging the intellectual property rights claims of the pharmaceuticals. After the debacle in Seattle, the Global South had organized collectively to ensure that the rules of international trade did not continue to deepen the impoverishment of the billions of poor farmers in the South. Since 2001, there had been negotiations with the former colonized peoples over the future rules in a round of negotiations that had been named after the city of Doha, Qatar. From the moment of those negotiations in November 2001 until December 2015 there had been nothing but duplicitous back and forth between the North and the peoples of the South. The designation of these negotiations as the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) never seriously considered addressing the obstacles placed in the global trading system to foster real trading cooperation, which supports socioeconomic transformation in the South. 
From the formation of the WTO the African members along with others from the Global South had taken a collective stand on the hypocrisy of the North in relation to trade and investment, intellectual property and agriculture. Since the WTO came into existence, the countries of the European Union and North America failed to live up to the expectations at the end of the Uruguay Round that they would liberalize their agriculture sector and significantly reduce their subsidies. In the particular case of farmers from Africa, there had been opposition to the subsidies granted to European farmers, while African farmers live in poverty. 
In the particular case of African cotton exporters “ Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali “ collectively known as the Cotton 4 or C-4 “ they had successfully urged fellow WTO members to stand with Africa on questions of food security and the outstanding questions of subsidies. At the Nairobi 10 Ministerial Meeting, Amina Mohamed as Chairperson of the meeting jettisoned the claims of the Global South and hurriedly agreed to exclude the African Issues before the WTO. The newspapers of the financial barons in Kenya then proceeded to publicize the outcome pointing to a nebulous Nairobi package that postponed real discussions of the trade war against the South by the North. 
Somalia a political football: Question of oil and gas discoveries 
Attention had already been drawn to how the question of Somalia has been manipulated for the past fifty years by the Kenya barons. The manipulation of the poor refugees reached new heights as the Kenyan leadership has threatened to close the largest refugee camp in the world. 
The anti-Pan African position of the Kenyans reached new lows over the question of the demarcation of the land and sea boundaries. After Kenyans had agreed with the British to maintain the Northern Frontier District as part of Kenya in 1964, there were questions as to the real boundaries between Kenya and Somalia. These questions became more urgent after oil and gas companies began to explore the very large reserves of oil and gas from the Somalia coast through Kenya, Tanzania, down to Mozambique. Faced with differing maps from the colonial offices of Britain and Italy, the Kenyans and Somalians have been disputing a narrow triangle off in the Indian Ocean, about 100,000 square kilometers (62,000 square miles). Capitalists and speculators from Kenya, Somalia and their external supporters covet this area because it has a large deposit of oil and gas. Neither the political leaders of Kenya nor the possible leaders of Somalia offered a Pan-African vision of shared responsibility and cooperation to develop the resources in order to benefit the peoples of Africa. Instead, Kenya sought to use their legal, economic and regional muscle to start exploration and to begin discussions with foreign oil companies. 
Faced with the aggressive position of the Kenyan barons, the Somalis decided to take the matter to the International Court of Justice. Kenya objected to legal arbitration of an area that should not be disputed if Kenya supported the goals of a future united Africa. The position of Kenya thus far on border issues in Eastern Africa goes against the spirit of the African Union s position with respect to Delimitation and Demarcation of Boundaries in Africa. 
Kenya ineligible to lead Africa at this point 
From the above reasons, this author wants to remind readers of the role of Kenya in becoming the champion of Israel and hosting the Israeli Prime Minister in July of 2016. The Kenyan President proudly claimed that Kenya would be an advocate for Israel before the African Union. This leadership under Uhuru Kenyatta, William Ruto and Amina Mohammed has thus agreed to undermine the Pan African position of supporting the self-determination of the Palestinian peoples. 
One can raise similar questions with respect to the real commitment of Kenya to continue to respect the rights of the peoples of Western Sahara. For the past two years the government of Morocco has been on an intense campaign to rejoin the African Union. In principle, progressive Africans welcome the return of Morocco to the African Union, but it must be spelt out clearly to Morocco that their return will be without conditions. That is, the political leadership of Morocco cannot demand that Africa drop recognition of the Polisario leadership. The summit of the African Union in January 2017 will be a testing ground to see how many societies of Africa will stand firm against Morocco and their supporters in France. 
If not Amin Mohammed, then who? 
Of the current six candidates to lead the African Union, the one candidate with a clear track record of commitment to the goals of Pan Africanism is Abdoulaye Bathily of Senegal. As a progressive historian, Bathily made his mark among a generation of intellectuals. Unfortunately, however, this position of the AU Commission Chair is being pushed by the government of Senegal with both France and Morocco dictating the foreign policy choices of Senegal. Without this subservience to France and Morocco by the Senegalese leadership, Bathily would be the obvious choice. 
The candidacies of Chad, Botswana and Equatorial Guinea already foundered at the meeting of the African Union in Kigali. Like Senegal, the government of Chad fronts for western interests and Chad was one of the few countries to send troops to fight with NATO to destroy Libya. Africa needs to take an independent position on the question of the manipulation of the so-called war on terror and on this matter, Chad ranks with those who need to account for their relationship with Boko Haram. 
Jakaya Kikwete has been a colorless leader of Tanzania for ten years. His friendship with leaders of the George W. Bush party in the USA will raise questions; however, with the arrival of Donald Trump, that faction of the US militarists, the Bush faction is no longer in the driver s seat. 
African intellectuals and activists cannot afford to be bystanders at this moment. In this short essay, this author has pointed out how at every step of the way since 1963, Kenya worked against African independence. During the anti-apartheid struggles, Kenya supported UNITA and the MNR and for good measure, western security established the banking infrastructure for illicit dealing through Bank of Credit and Commerce International. There was the formation of the Safari Club C France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Morocco and the conservative elements of the USA “ to support the apartheid regime in South Africa and the conservative leaders of Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. 
The one candidate with a clear track record of commitment to the goals of Pan Africanism is Abdoulaye Bathily of Senegal. 
Since the global war on terror, Kenya has participated in the rendition programs of the US intelligence agencies and stepped up their business operations by working with the CIA to fund groups such as the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism (APRCT). ARPCT was a coalition of military entrepreneurs who understood war as a business and knew how to manipulate western intelligence agencies. 
According to a report in the Washington Post in 2006, Despite its name, the ARPCT probably does little to combat terrorism and is more interested in maintaining the lawless status quo in which the warlords thrive. Experts say the moniker is an attempt to make the group appealing to Western governments, highlighting their battle against the spread of an Islamic militia. 
Ten years after this exposure, organizations such as the Bell Pottinger group continue to wage information warfare against Kenyans and Africans on the so-called terrorist threats in Eastern Africa. If Kenya had spent every cent that it has been spending on Operation Linda Nchi on building schools, roads, hospitals and water supply systems in Somalia, then the issues before Africa and the African Union would be very different from the divisive questions of illicit trade in sugar, charcoal and the question of boundary demarcation. 
That eastern Africa continues to be strategically important to western security interests can be gleaned from the patience that the British exhibited in ensuring that Kenya maintained a military agreement with Britain for Britain to base troops in Kenya. In this case, Britain is acting as a front for US military interest. Kenya is important strategically to the U.S. Access to Kenyan air and a seaport facilitates imperial capabilities to project air and naval power in the Indian Ocean. 
The political leadership of China has bought into the idea that the Kenyan leadership is anti-imperialist because the leaders were taken to The Hague and the ICC. This kind of analysis by Chinese strategists exposes their limited understandings of class struggles in Eastern Africa and the history of Kenya selling out Africans. From time to time newspapers and journalists revisit the scandals after scandals [4] with respect to primitive accumulation in Kenya. 
Conclusion 
What needs to be understood is that Kenya s Goldenberg or Anglo Leasing scandals and others are components of a model of capital accumulation in the illicit global economy. This illicit global economy is a legitimate component of the financialization forms of capital that diminishes real production and commerce. 
When the AU was formed, the Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) had been mandated to bring to the fore the questions that affect Africans in all six regions. It is in this context where there needs to be new focus of the AU. At the last meeting in Kigali, there were feeble efforts to raise revenues for the AU. None of the governments took seriously the illicit global economy and the recommendations of the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows. The western donors dominate the discussions on how to stem financial flows and downplay the importance of the return of stolen assets. Kenya was quite willing to raise the question of reparative justice with respect to the crimes of Britain during the colonial wars, but that same Kenyan leadership refuses to support the reparative claims of the global African community.

47,"Russia attacked energy, telecom and media in Britain: government official","(Reuters) - Russian cyber operatives have attacked Britain s media, telecommunications and energy sectors over the past year, according to prepared remarks by the head of the government s main cyber defense agency. Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), declined to provide any details on the attacks in a speech scheduled for Wednesday in London. The remarks follow comments on Monday from Prime Minister Theresa May in which she accused Russia of spreading disinformation and meddling in elections, echoing a heated debate in the United States over alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Russian has strongly denied any election interference in the United States. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond when asked after normal business hours for comment on Martin s remarks. The NCSC, a branch of the GCHQ, Britain s main signals intelligence agency, has been in operation for a year and is charged with shoring up cyber security by working with a wide range of stakeholders. Martin said in his prepared remarks: I can confirm that Russian interference, seen by the National Cyber Security Centre over the past the year, has included attacks on the UK media, telecommunication and energy sectors. The agency was actively engaging with international partners, industry and civil society to tackle the threat from Russia, he said. Martin echoed May s comments that Russia was trying to undermine the international system with information warfare and cyber attacks. Cyber security experts have long worried about attacks on electrical grids in particular, but Martin offered no evidence that the alleged Russian attacks succeeded in penetrating power systems or other critical infrastructure in the UK.

48,"No 'bespoke' Brexit, transition means 'status quo': Barnier","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said Britain must accept the full economic and legal status quo in a transition period after it leaves the EU and should expect no tailor-made terms on trade in its future relationship. Suggesting a transition should run for 21 months from Brexit on March 30, 2019 until the current EU budget expires at the end of 2020, Barnier said Britain would certainly remain subject to EU laws and courts during that transition. During this period, the EU legal framework including on jurisdiction would continue to apply to Britain, Barnier said in an interview published on Tuesday in Germany s Handelsblatt newspaper. We don t have time to invent a new model. So for a short time after the formal exit from the EU the economic status quo would continue to apply, which besides the internal market also includes the customs union and collective political decisions. In a version of the interview in Belgium s L Echo, he said of the transition: The only difference is that the British would no longer take part in decisions on European legislation. British Prime Minister Theresa May has proposed a transition of around two years to give time to put a new free trade pact in place, although she faces opposition in London from some Brexit supporters who want a clean, quick break. Barnier noted that May had rejected the option of staying in the EU single market long-term the Norwegian model as he called it, referring to Norway s membership of the EU internal market, accepting all its rules and costs without having a say. So we must work on other hypotheses, Handelsblatt quoted him as saying. Another option would be a free trade treaty using the example of the CETA agreement with Canada. It would take several years, however, to negotiate such an agreement. Asked if that meant there could be a specifically British model along the lines of the bespoke arrangements May has referred to without giving detail, Barnier replied simply: No. Quoted by L Echo, he said a trade deal could be agreed in three years meaning that if talks start in December it would be ready just in time for a transition ending in December 2020. He said his staff were already working on drafting a withdrawal treaty that will include terms for transition. Barnier said he still hoped that May could provide more detail on her offer to meet financial commitments on withdrawal so that EU leaders could agree in December to end their refusal to negotiate a future trade deal. May told an EU summit last week that she could not agree a figure until she knows what trade terms the EU offers. Barnier said it was important to de-dramatise talks on the payment.",FAKE
49,A Trump Economic Boom? The Fed May Stand in the Way - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON ” Investors in financial markets, and those predicting faster economic growth in 2017, would do well to remember the famous words that William McChesney Martin Jr. the former Federal Reserve chairman, uttered way back in 1955: The Fed s job is to remove the punch bowl just as the party gets going. Donald J. Trump s promises to cut taxes and regulation and to increase spending on infrastructure and defense have convinced many that a sugar high in the near term will goose the economy. But Fed officials say the economy is already expanding at something close to its maximum sustainable pace, meaning faster growth would drive inflation toward unwelcome levels. To avoid overheating, the Fed could respond by raising interest rates more quickly. The more Mr. Trump stimulates growth, the faster the Fed is likely to increase rates. I guess I would argue that I think people have gotten a bit ahead of themselves about what a Trump presidency would mean, said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura. If we have a big stimulus, the logical thing for the Fed to do is to raise rates faster. There isn t a whole heck of a lot of scope to just let the economy run under those circumstances. There s a big question about whether fiscal stimulus under Trump just leads to higher interest rates. Underscoring that question, the Fed is expected to raise its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the first time since last December in light of new economic data. The rate sits in a range of 0. 25 percent to 0. 5 percent, a low level intended to stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and . Analysts predict the Fed will shift the range upward by a quarter of a percentage point, modestly reducing those incentives. The rate increase is widely regarded as a foregone conclusion. The odds, derived from asset prices, topped 95 percent Monday, according to the CME Group. The looming question is how quickly the Fed will continue to raise rates in 2017. Economic forecasts always require large assumptions, but that is particularly true in the present case because Mr. Trump has provided relatively few details about his plans. Perhaps the most accurate thing that can be said about Mr. Trump s victory is that it has increased the uncertainty of the economic outlook. At this juncture, it is premature to reach firm conclusions about what will likely occur, William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said in a recent speech. During his campaign, Mr. Trump predicted 4 percent annual growth, and his actions since Election Day point to a goal of job creation. Our No. 1 priority is going to be the economy, get back to 3 to 4 percent growth, Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump s pick to serve as Treasury secretary, said last month. Many economists regard such growth predictions as fanciful the economy has been mired in an extended period of slow growth and the reasons, including an aging population and a dearth of innovation, are unlikely to change quickly. Some think Mr. Trump is more likely to push the economy into recession than to catalyze a new boom. Even if Mr. Trump is right, however, the Fed does not want 4 percent growth. The central bank s outlook has become increasingly gloomy. Officials estimated in September that annual growth of 1. 8 percent was the maximum sustainable pace, and they predicted growth would not exceed 2 percent in the next three years. They will update those forecasts Wednesday, but large shifts are unlikely. Fed officials also are increasingly convinced that steady job growth has substantially eliminated the backlog of people seeking work. The unemployment rate fell to 4. 6 percent in November, a level the Fed regards as healthy. For years, Fed officials urged Congress to increase fiscal spending. Now, Mr. Trump is promising to do just that ” and the Fed has concluded that it is too late. Stanley Fischer, the Fed s vice chairman, said last month the Fed might still benefit from fiscal stimulus because it could raise rates more quickly. That would increase the Fed s ability to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates. But such gains would come at real cost: A fiscal stimulus would increase the federal government s debt burden, which already is at a high level by historical standards, reducing the room for a fiscal response to a future downturn. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed s chairwoman, urged Congress last month to be mindful that the government is already on the hook for more spending as baby boomers age into retirement. With the . D. P. ratio at around 77 percent, there s not a lot of fiscal space, should a shock to the economy occur, an adverse shock, that did require fiscal stimulus, she said. The tension between fiscal and monetary policy is likely to unfold in slow motion. Mr. Trump has promised to press for rapid changes in government policy, but Congress is not built for speed. A similar effort to cut taxes at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, for example, was signed into law on June 7, 2001. The impact of new cuts, and any increase in infrastructure spending that Mr. Trump can persuade dubious Republicans to embrace, would be felt mostly in future years. Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Moody s Analytics, predicted that tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and spending would fuel faster growth in the first half of Mr. Trump s term. But he said that the Fed s rate increases, and restrictions on trade and immigration, would gradually begin to take a larger toll. By the end, Mr. Zandi predicted, the American economy would be unnervingly close to recession. The Fed and markets in general will ultimately wash out any benefit, Mr. Zandi said Monday. The economy under President Trump ultimately will be diminished. Other economists are more optimistic, predicting that the stimulus will not be fully offset by Fed policy. Mr. Dudley appeared to endorse this view in his recent speech, suggesting that the rise in financial markets was broadly appropriate. Some of Mr. Trump s proposals also could increase the economy s potential growth rate, for example by improving infrastructure or encouraging corporate investment. On the other hand, the Fed s march toward higher rates may be amplified by the bond market. Rates are already rising, and investors concerned about inflation and larger federal deficits are likely to generate persistent upward pressure. Those effects are already visible. Stock prices have climbed since Mr. Trump s surprising victory, increasing the wealth of shareholders. But borrowing costs also climbed. The average rate on a mortgage loan was 4. 13 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, up from 3. 54 percent just before the election.",FAKE
50,MARINE CORPS GENERAL WARNS U.S. TROOPS: There s A War Coming,"While the mainstream media remains transfixed on a phony Trump-Russian collusion story, they completely ignore the real news, about how things appear to be heating up between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the U.S.A Marine Corps commandant on Thursday warned U.S. troops stationed in Norway to be prepared for a coming war.Neller pointed to the near future possibility of Russia and the Pacific theater being the next major areas of conflict.Sgt. Maj. Ronald Green sounded a similar tone. Just remember why you re here, Green said. They re watching. Just like you watch them, they watch you. We ve got 300 Marines up here; we could go from 300 to 3,000 overnight. We could raise the bar. The warnings came a day before Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told troops at Fort Bragg, N.C., that storm clouds are gathering over the Korean Peninsula.Whether the comments were more than motivational rhetoric remained unclear.Neller and Green s arrival in Norway coincided with heightened tensions between the U.S. and its NATO allies and Russia. According to Military.com, Russia warned Norway that its decision to host a new unit of U.S. troops through the end of 2018 would negatively affect relations. FOX NewsAccording to UK Express, Russian President Putin said the US missile defense sites in Romania containing interceptor missiles could also house ground-to-ground intermediate-range cruise missiles, which would be in violation of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.He told the military officials that both the US and NATO have been accelerating build-up of infrastructure in Europe and emphasised that the deployment of NATO forces near Russia s borders had threatened its security.He said: When we move military units on our own territory, they present it as some kind of a threat. And when they move military bases, infrastructure and new weapons near our borders they present it as something normal. It s probably normal for those who do it, but not for us. NATO has deployed military units to Poland and the Baltics to reassure allies worried over Russia s intentions following its 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Crimea and its support for pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.Mr Putin mentioned NATO s US-led missile defense system and efforts to develop new prospective conventional weapons among other security challenges.He added: They are searching for some violations on our part while consistently infringing on it themselves. All that seriously affects security in Europe and in the whole world. Mr Putin accused the US of violating a landmark Cold War-era nuclear arms pact and harbouring aggressive intentions, and pledged to fend off any potential threats.FOX News At a Q&A session with the troops in the Norwegian Home Guard base near Trondheim, Neller said that the U.S. could shift its focus from the Middle East to Eastern Europe, citing Russia s conflicts with Ukraine and Georgia as justification. He told the Marines that they should be prepared for a big-ass fight on the horizon.Russia has reportedly been uneasy about the presence of American troops close to its borders. The 300 U.S. Marines deployed to Norway in June 2016 were the first foreign troops allowed to operate in the country since World War II.In September of this year, Russia conducted a joint-military exercise with neighboring Belarus that involved 12,700 troops.A new National Security Strategy unveiled by the Trump administration on Monday singled out Russia and China as two world powers challenging American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity.

52,GOP candidates fight for spotlight ahead of Milwaukee debate,"The leading Republican presidential candidates are fighting for the spotlight as they charge into Tuesday night's primary debate, with Marco Rubio releasing a biting new ad ripping his former political mentor and Donald Trump suggesting he's arrested Ben Carson's rise in the polls.

Carson, for his part, has spent the last several days sparring with the media and his rivals over reports questioning his personal story, which is the crux of his campaign.

""I am trying to move on,"" Carson told Fox News. But his campaign manager also says Carson will punch back if an opponent challenges him on stage Tuesday night -- suggesting a departure for Carson from past debates, where he mostly avoided the fray.

The prime-time debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and The Wall Street Journal, will be held at 9 p.m. ET, from Milwaukee, preceded by an earlier 7 p.m. ET debate with lower-polling candidates.

This is the first time that just eight candidates will be on the main stage, a change that could give the contenders more time to explain their positions and engage each other.

Florida Sen. Rubio, in the hours before the debate, launched a striking ad against GOP rival Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor. The ad plays clips of Bush, before the 2016 campaign, praising Rubio.

""I'm a huge Marco fan,"" Bush says in one clip. In another, he says, ""He's probably the most articulate conservative on the scene today.""

The text of the ad blares: ""Jeb Bush before his phony attacks.""

Bush, the former front-runner, has struggled in every debate so far, and Rubio is no doubt angling for the edge against him in Tuesday's showdown. At the last debate, Rubio deftly parried a critique by Bush of his Senate absences.

Rubio is currently third in most national polls, followed closely by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who by many accounts had the stand-out moment in the last debate by slamming the CNBC moderators for allegedly unfair and off-topic questions. Speaking with Fox News on Monday, Rubio said the polls have been ""up and down,"" but ""what I'm going to do is I'm going to focus on the message of my campaign.""

Still tangling for the lead are Carson and Trump.

Speaking with Fox News, Trump pointed to the most recent polling in saying he's back on top.

""I'm No. 1 in the polls, as you know, in every single -- I think I'm No. 1 in every single state. I'm now No. 1 again in Iowa. I had lost Iowa for a period of time, and I didn't quite understand it,"" Trump said.

Trump has shown no hesitation about going after Carson, for everything from his past writings about having anger issues growing up, to stories questioning elements of his personal narrative, to Carson's statement that Egypt's pyramids were built by the biblical Joseph to store grain.

""He's having a hard time. The pyramids are solid structures. You can't put grain in the pyramids because they're solid structures,"" Trump said.

Trump, who hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" over the weekend, also made headlines overnight by suggesting a ""boycott"" against Starbucks over its holiday cups that are missing winter or Christmas scenes. But then Trump added, ""Seriously, I don't care.""

In a reminder of one of the key issues he's running on, though, Trump released a new policy paper Tuesday focusing on U.S.-China relations.

His campaign claims that under a ""Trump administration trade will flourish. However, for free trade to bring prosperity to America, it must also be fair trade.""",FAKE
53,Man Is Fatally Shot and 2 Officers Are Hurt at Brooklyn Housing Complex - The New York Times,"A man was fatally shot by the police at a public housing complex in Brooklyn on Saturday after he hit two officers with a police baton he had grabbed from one of them, the police said. The officers, who were in uniform, went to a building in the Van Dyke I Houses in the Brownsville neighborhood around 1:30 p. m. in response to a 911 call about a suspicious man, the police said. The officers approached a man on the building s ninth floor and asked for his identification and a scuffle ensued, according to James Secreto, chief of the Police Department s Housing Bureau. The man grabbed a baton from one of the officers and began hitting them both on the head, Chief Secreto said. Both officers then shot the man, who was pronounced dead at the scene, at 362 Sutter Avenue, the police said. Relatives and the police identified the man as Erickson Gomez Brito, 21, of 563 Mother Gaston Boulevard. One of the officers sustained a gash on his head, the police said. Both officers were taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center for treatment, where they were in stable condition, the police said. Omahis Gomez Brito, 19, the victim s sister, said her brother had been treated for depression three years ago but had not been taking medication recently. She also said he was treated for addiction at that time, but she did not specify for what. Speaking to reporters outside the building where she and Mr. Brito lived with their parents, Ms. Brito said: I want justice for my brother. I want to know why they killed him. Mr. Brito s father, Osiris Gomez, said in Spanish that his son was not violent. Mr. Brito s aunt lives in the building where the shooting occurred, relatives said. Ms. Brito said the aunt lived on the first floor, and she was not sure why her brother was on the ninth. The Van Dyke I complex is in the 73rd Precinct as well as in the middle of a area that is among the poorest in the city, according to an analysis done by Queens College in 2014. There had been 12 homicides in the precinct this year, though none at the complex, Police Department statistics show. Katt Williams, who lives in the neighborhood, said she knew Mr. Brito.

56,Comment on Mass Fish Deaths: Millions Have Been Found Dead All Over The World In The Past Month by Whackamole,"Mass Fish Deaths: Millions Have Been Found Dead All Over The World In The Past Month May 20th, 2014 
Millions of fish are suddenly dying all over the planet. In fact, there have been dozens of mass fish death events reported in the past month alone. So why is this happening? Why are fish dying in unprecedented numbers all over the world? When more than six tons of fish died in Marina Del Ray over the weekend, it made headlines all over the United States. But the truth is that what just happened off the southern California coast is just the tip of the iceberg. In 2014, mass fish die-offs have pretty much become a daily event globally. Individually, each event could perhaps be dismissed as an anomaly, but as you will see below when they are all put together into one list it truly is rather stunning. So is there a reason why so many fish are dying? Is there something that connects these mass fish death events? Has something about our environment changed? The following are just a few examples of the mass fish death reports that have been coming in day after day from all over the globe ¦ 
*Over the weekend, thousands upon thousands of fish died just off the southern California coastline ¦ 
California Fish and Wildlife workers are still scooping dead sea life from the surface of the harbor Monday after thousands of dead anchovies, stingrays and even an octopus died and floated up over the weekend. 
So far officials have cleaned up 6 tons of dead fish , and they still have a long way to go. 
*The death of approximately 35,000 fish up in Minnesota is being blamed on a lack of oxygen . 
*The recent die off of thousands of fish in the Shark River near Belmar, New Jersey is also being blamed on oxygen depletion . 
*Officials in Menifee, California are still trying to figure out what caused the death of thousands of fish in Menifee Lake a few weeks ago ¦ 
Authorities continued testing the water in Menifee Lake Friday after thousands of dead fish have been seen floating since last weekend. 
Menifee city officials first heard reports Saturday of floating fish at the lake, which is located on private property about a half-mile east of the 215 Freeway. 
*In the Gulf of Mexico, dolphins and sea turtles are dying in record numbers . 
*Maryland officials are still puzzled by the death of 7,000 Atlantic menhaden last month ¦ 
State environmental scientists are investigating the cause of a fish kill that left about 7,000 dead Atlantic menhaden in waters that include the Inner Harbor and Fells Point. 
Jay Apperson, spokesman for the Maryland Department of the Environment, said that biologists went by boat on Tuesday to the area of Monday s fish kill. He says the area extended from the mouth of the Patapsco River, up the Baltimore Harbor to Fells Point and Fort McHenry. 
*Mass fish die-offs in Lake Champlain up in Vermont are being called the new normal by government officials. 
*Along the coast of northern California, seals and young sea lions are dying in record numbers . 
*Three months ago, farmers in Singapore lost 160 tons of fish to a mass die-off event. 
*Back in September, approximately 40 kilometers of the Fuhe River in China was covered with dead fish . 
*Also during last September, close to ten tons of dead fish were found floating on a lake near the town of Komotini, Greece .

Rev 6: The Fourth Seal: Death 7When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come. 8I looked, and behold, an ashen horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death; and Hades was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth. MichaelfromTheEconomicCollapse 
Interesting parallel. Obviously we are not at that point yet, but without a doubt lots of death is coming in the future.

Just remember oxygen deprivation is what they always claim. When they either don t know, or do not want you to know. Harry Paranockus 
How do turtles and dolphins fit into that scenario? K 
That is in the Gulf of Mexico. Still plenty of chemicals from the oil and corexit there. If the various small oil leaks were ever stopped. The gulf would still need a decade, before I would eat anything out of it. Sharon Equality-Now Johnson Mi 
Exactly! I have sworn off anything from the Gulf and because they re such a large shrimp region, I stopped eating shrimp for the next 15 years. That BP oil spill and the Corexit chemicals they dumped, only destroyed sea life. There is sea life washing up on the shores with all kinds of tumors, never before seen. I ll pass; growing my own food. K2 
If they say pollution ¦will you agree with them? K 
Yes, as long as they explain how broad a term pollution can be. Chemical, viral, radioactive. K2

The answer is under everyone nose. Does anyone recall all the floating debris floating in the ocean when they went looking for the missing plane? 
It turns out that debris was garbage. Gerald Celente has mentioned this for quite some time now that governments are using the ocean as their underwater garbage dumps. You have all kinds of garbage, probably tens of millions of tons of trash which no doubt includes toxins and chemicals dumped in the ocean floors. Sharon Equality-Now Johnson Mi 
Yes you are right, not to mention all the missing oil after the Gulf Oil spill. It didn t just evaporate like some people want to suggest, which is of course impossible. 
How about fracking in the USA. That s one reason. Off the coast of Somalia, developed countries have dumped chemical wastes off their coast, creating dead-zones. They ve been begging us for years but they were considered throw away people. They couldn t feed their families so they captures ships which entered the region; held them for ransom. Developed countries does this around the world. There was an investigation of the electronic wastes that are collected in the USA for recyclying. 
They re then dumped in regions in China and off various African coasts. Now that it s come home to affect us from our own fracking and nuclear wastes, we re recognizing the problem. DJohn1 
Oxygen deprived fish? Most of the world s oxygen comes from plants in the oceans. If they are suddenly dying off, we are in big trouble. The entire supply for the planet is in jeopardy. The key here is balance between carbon dioxide and oxygen. If that goes south then all the life on this planet could go with it. Sharon Equality-Now Johnson Mi

The balance of the world s ecosystems is very delicate. Altho I don t always agree with the environmentalists, this is one area where I believe they re correct. 
I have a hard time believing any official reports regarding this underwater holocaust. In fact, there have been many similar reports of birds falling out of the sky, en masse. Probably not at the magnitude of fish, and other water-dwelling creatures. But this problem seems to have no serious precedence in history. Maybe some isolated cases, but nothing like this. (?) 
Oxygen depletion?? Ok, even if that were possible, what causes global oxygen depletion in our waters??? I don t know about you, but things like nuclear radiation, or heavy chemical dumping comes to mind. Maybe even some secret spent rod-cooling down deep. Who knows. Sharon Equality-Now Johnson Mi

Oxygen depletion has been happening for awhile. It s called dead zones when nothing lives in those certain areas; as a result of pollution. Fish die and so do marine plants. marty

Lessee ¦we ve got Fukushima radiation washing through the Pacific, cycling around South America and the Horn. In the Gulf we ve got hundreds of thousands of tons of corexit and a billion or so gallons of oil sludge and that s cycling into the Atlantic. Pollution in India and China are so off the scale that we, here in America, would have to personally remember the 60 s to fathom (I was a kid in the 60 s and California Smog was what you see in China today). I don t know why river systems would be affected other than the water flowing to the oceans is constantly picking up contaminants along the way. (In California it is unsafe to drink from any natural source of water.) Between Fukushima, Corexit and Oil sludge ¦I think we ve hit the lotto for the spreading die off. K2 
In many areas sewage from cities and industrial refuse is dumped into rivers. Not just in the states but in many countries. jaxon64 
I believe I can explain some of the river and bay die-offs from lack of oxygen Here in the Chesapeake region we are now seeing dead zones in the glorious Chesapeake Bay. The cause?.. ETHANOL ¦ Increased demand for ethanol has caused many local farmers to turn away from traditional crops and convert to farming massive amounts of corn. The corn requires large amounts of nitrate additives to the soil. Nitrate run-offs into the rivers, creeks and tributaries have caused large amounts of algae bloom on the surface of the water “underneath, the natural, oxygen producing sea grasses that grow from the floor of the rivers and bay are dying for lack of sunlight. When the O2 producing seagrasses die off-EVERYTHING in the dead zone dies off “sort of like a permanent red tide zone. Crabs, fish, skates, oysters, mussles clams ¦all die in the dead area ¦.these keep growing in the bay as more nitrates from corn growerss get run off into the tributaries. So there is the cause of the biggest problem in the Chesapeake Bay ”our government regulations to increase ethanol levels is killing our Bay “one of the most beautiful and unique estuaries of abundant life on the planet.. chris 
It could be bacterial and spread by the wind. It could be many things but the question is what are the government officials with their well equipped microbiological and chemical labs saying it is? Are they not doing any research? Is it really just a case of scooping up the dead fish and not investigating why? jaxon64 
The govt, of course, will blame it on man “then increase his taxes and increase their control and regulation. ( but never actually address the problem) ¦.OR “ option #2 “they will place a media ban on mentioning the die-offs and call anyone who is concerned a conspiracy nut right wing extremist or climate change denier Sharon Equality-Now Johnson Mi 
The government and the EPA has been warning against this for decades. The greedy oil companies and the chemical fertilizer companies have been pushing back. Of course they have their chosen Republican politicians who they pay to block legislation; which would tighten up on the fracking chemicals forced into the ground in their tar sands quest. Reason 
How about radiation from Japan s disaster. I think that alone could contaminate all the waters of the world. Let s pressure our govs. to get rid of nuclear energy and learn to do without so many plug in gadgets!!! Adrian Johnson 
Too late ! Nothing done now can undo contamination of the seas from Fukushima s radiation. Cynical Guy 42 
I find it interesting how in the csmonitor article, one die-off is blamed on a heat wave, while the other is blamed on excessive snow. Question: Heat waves and heavy snow have happened for a very long time. Why are they suddenly causing die-offs? JÃ¸rn Andreassen 
plastic “ manmade waste “ is to blame. The plastic breaks down to microparticles and enter the gills of every fish in the ocean. Everyone who have thrown plastic in nature is to blame. (The same thing is happening to birds as well. Every bird you find dead will get plastic in their bellies.) RapidRay01 .

Well all of the other people here sure seem to get it. I get so tired of hearing about some die off or outbreak of disease or other man made disaster and the officials are all left scratching their heads. We dont know what may have caused this we are clueless. We have to study this for another five years before we have an explanation. Well unless you have been living under a rock for the past couple of decades or maybe a brainwashed tv addicted sheeple with no clue as to how nature works and what we have been doing to the earth and our ecosystem the answers is slapping everyone right upside their heads. We have polluted and raped the land we are killing off the bees, butterflies, birds, fish, frogs, and everything else. All of these things work and feed off of each other hence the ecoSYSTEM. You can t just go around spraying weed killer and insecticide by the millions of tons and not have unexpected results. You can t raise 100,000 pigs chickens or cows in filth and feed them all gmo corn and antibiotics and expect a good result and a healthy product. Best advice is for all of us who are awake is to grow whatever you can not just so that you can survive the shtf crisis but so that you can eat a healthy diet full of vitamins and natural minerals. The meat you eat can be raised well and healthy and have a good life before it feeds you. We have become way to detached from our food and nature in general turn off the tv go outside grow a garden raise some animals stop supporting the system that is killing us all. B.M.

I know this conversation is 9 months old but I would tend to agree. If we have been polluting for the last 60 years then wouldn t you have records of mass die offs over the last 50 or so years?? why are ALL of these within the last year or so?? Pollution does not make sense! well, maybe the radiation in the water from Japan.. but if it was the pollution we would have evidence spanning decades and not just the last two years!

Geologists said the earth ˜went bonkers in April this year with some very large earthquakes all over starting with Peru s huge quake.

I like what many of you said. Especially what Jaxson64 has said about ethanol. Our corn crops for food is all being denied by that giant food company, I forgot the name ¦someone think of it ¦..oh, something Santo! liberals and their ethanol and yet the stupid republicans do nothing. I also wonder if this santo corp. is working with HARRP, and maybe sending electromagnetic pulses beaming off from space to hit parts of the ocean? They talk about how HARRP, controls weather. someone could be doing this but I believe what many of you said. mankind is out of control and is polluting oceans on all 4 corners. I think if the public really knew what was going on ¦where is greenpeace and other radical lib organizations crying about all the toxins we are dumping into the greatest creation of all time, our oceans?

For the last 10 years, there has been numerous signs of drastic changes to our planet. The wide spread of die off occurrences correlates to the short period of time and shines a light on the dark secrets of our corporations and governing bodies. If you really want to know how bad it is, look up Peek Oil and see how close we are to serious global changing disasters. There is an evil that has literally consumed our planet. Our government knows that effects of there actions. They pay billions of dollars for the research, however, if it effects the goal of profit, that research is swept under the rug by corrupt politics. Remember the last oil spill? There are regulations to put shut off valves on the pipes for each segment of specified distance to avoid these problems. Just like the code states for residential plumbing. But it would have cost too much and took too much time. So evil took over and we raped our planet. Other significant signs would be the number of natural disasters tripled compared to the previous 10 years. There are 12 times more tornadoes occurring now compared to the last decade. UV rays from the sun have become 25% stronger and there is 20% more acidity in our rainfall. 25 years ago we had over 500 major meat suppliers for distribution. Today, we have three which means we are at the mercy of the governing body to fight off corruption and evil. Yet the number of autistic children has tripled. McDonald s meat has 40% meat and the rest filler. You think you are buying better meat at the grocery store, but it s still coming from the same distributor with the same practices. Is it odd that in the last 5th. years the northeast has experienced a dramatic and alarming increase of allergens. This is due to changes in our climate that are just not natural. The world has fallen to gluttony and greed. Think about it, you would like to do something to help stop the destruction and leave our children with a righteous coarse, but you can t do anything because you have to go to work. You need to make that ridiculous car payment because its just too important for you not to have a nicer car than the neighbors. Oh yea, and you don t have time because you have fantasy football leagues, and Country Clubs to attend. So you turn your back and worry about you and your life. And our government knows it. You think debt is a choice? It is a control tactic to keep you in line like a sheep because gluttony has been ingrained in our souls and no one is willing to sacrifice their time to take control of our world. If just 50 % of our population protested and did not buy gas until the price was lowered to 2.00, we would let serious results. But you can t do that, you have to drive the fancy car to the vacation house. It s time we stood up and said enough. It s time we form a mob with like purpose and use the power to stop this corrupt destruction of our world. If we organize and pull together as a force, we could stop the dumping in our water, we could stop the additives that are put in our children s food, we can clean the pharmaceuticals out of our drinking water, and we could perhaps salvage our planet for human kind. Enough is enough, it hasto start now. ThomasW

For fish to die in rivers, lakes, and oceans all over the world in such massive quantities over such a brief time, I suspect it has something to do with new technology ”perhaps some type of radio frequency transmission to/from a satellite(s), EMF waves, or a new/different type of chemtrail ingredient. joanr 
New global threat- a third of the fish will die! Gardeners have long been aware that if you water a pot plant with a small amount of green washing up liquid, then the molecules in the washing up liquid bind together to form a seal which excludes the air and keeps the plant hydrated for a longer period, used by those going on holiday. People have been using green washing up liquid for decades, it has been washing down drains and rivers into the ocean. I wrote to the chairman of one of the leading manufacturers of cleaning products with this information some time ago. Are these sudden deaths among the fish stocks anything to do with this I ask? Rauh 
Our solar system has moved below the galactic equator after 2012, things are beginning to happen that we don t know about.

57,Trump Has NEVER Looked So Incompetent; His China Adviser Was Literally Found On Amazon (DETAILS),"With every new detail revealing itself about Donald Trump s administration, the humiliation that America is enduring is getting harder and harder to stomach. We have never seen an administration fail so hard from the start, and just when it seems it can get no worse, Trump sets a new precedent. The latest detail in Trump s White House will have Americans more disappointed than ever before.Apparently, the morons in the Trump administration are so incompetent and lazy, they aren t even able to choose top officials correctly. Vanity Fair just reported a VERY disturbing detail about Trump s China adviser, who was sought out by the POTUS son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Kushner chose this adviser not by interviewing experts, like a normal person Kushner found Trump s China adviser by searching Amazon. Vanity Fair wrote:At one point during the campaign, when Trump wanted to speak more substantively about China, he gave Kushner a summary of his views and then asked him to do some research. Kushner simply went on Amazon, where he was struck by the title of one book, Death by China, co-authored by Peter Navarro. He cold-called Navarro, a well-known trade-deficit hawk, who agreed to join the team as an economic adviser. (When he joined, Navarro was in fact the campaign s only economic adviser.) Kushner operated in much the same way when it came to crafting Trump s tax plan calling up someone for help out of the blue. Given the initial absence of pros who could do the job properly, he also tried his hand at writing speeches. Responding to criticism from the boss ( Jared, this is terrible! ), Kushner said, according to a person familiar with the episode, I m not a fucking speechwriter. I am a real-estate guy. The idiocy being displayed here is mind boggling. Kushner, who at least has the sense to admit that he s way out of his league and he s just a real-estate guy , is the person Trump has put in charge of basically everything. The same man that s looking for advisers on Amazon.Let s not forget that this idiot is the man in charge of bringing peace to the Middle East. With this amount of incompetency in the White House, it will be a miracle if the United States can get through Trump s presidency without a major crisis, although we re already getting pretty close to one after Trump s attack on Syria and Afghanistan, and his inflammatory comments toward China and North Korea.If anyone thought that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were going to being the check and balance for Trump, this report certainly crushes that hope. Even the most level headed people in Trump s administration are dangerously ill-equipped.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty Images",REAL

59,Is This Why Comey Broke: A Stack Of Resignation Letters From Furious FBI Agents,"Is This Why Comey Broke: A Stack Of Resignation Letters From Furious FBI Agents Source: Zero Hedge 
Conspiracy theories have swirled in recent days as to why FBI Director James Comey reopened Hillary's email investigation after just closing it back in July concluding that, although Hillary had demonstrated gross negligence in her establishment of a private email server, that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring a case against her. Democrats, after lavishing Comey with praise for months on concluding his investigation in an ""impartial"" way, have since lashed out at him for seeking to influence the 2016 election cycle with Hillary herself describing his recent actions as ""deeply troubling"". Republicans, on the other hand, have praised Comey's recent efforts as an attempt to correct a corrupt investigation that seemingly ignored critical evidence while granting numerous immunity agreements to Clinton staffers. 
According to the Daily Mail , and a source close to James Comey, the decision, at least in part, came after he ""could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI"" who ""felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist."" 
James Comey's decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI , including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. 
'The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn't recommend an indictment against Hillary,' said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades, shares family outings with him, and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week. 
'Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,' said the source. 'They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist.' 
According to the source, Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife, Patrice. 
He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. 
'The people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him,' the source continued. 'And that includes his wife, Pat. She kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state. 
Though we're sure there are many facets behind Comey's decision making process, we can all be quite certain, at this point, that he's not motivated by a desire to make friends having now alienated just about everyone in Washington, both in law enforcement and in both political parties. In fact, after Tim Kaine just last week praised Comey as a ""wonderful"" career public servant with the ""highest standards of integrity"" .... 
...everything has now been turned on it's head with Hillary calling his latest moves ""unprecedented and deeply troubling""...seemingly implying an attempt, on the part of Comey, to ""rig"" the election from Trump . 
Meanwhile, President Obama and Attorney General Loretta Lynch are apparently also ""furious"" with Comey over his recent decision. 
His announcement about the revived investigation, which came just 11 days before the presidential election, was greeted with shock and dismay by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the prosecutors at the Justice Department. 
'Jim told me that Lynch and Obama are furious with him,' the source said. 
'Lynch and Obama haven't contacted Jim directly,' said the source, 'but they've made it crystal clear through third parties that they disapprove of his effort to save face.' 
And while the decision to reopen the case may appease FBI agents and republicans, in the short-term, we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence. As such, we continue to question just how long Comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post. At a bare minimum, in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation, we fail to understand how an independent investigation into Hillary's email server isn't warranted. 
OOOOh! The remorse! The GUILT ! I can almost feel it from here! 
Get off it, ....you jabbering, fast talking, asshole. 
Statements? ... 'Reopening investigations' (Is that a maybe you wiil have a couple of interns fiddle with Emails a little longer?) and then having legal promptly announce they will take MONTHS and MONTHS to complete the case? ....

No, a resignation is in order. .. Declare a 'conflict of interest' and turn states evidence would be more like it. .... You - Are - A - Crook Dir Comey.

(VIDEO)","Hell just froze over, because Fox News is now on President Obama s side when it comes to his new gun safety executive order.Bill O Reilly said, during a segment on The O Reilly Factor, that the NRA and gun owners need to accept that background checks for buying guns are reasonable.I know how unbelievable that sounds, but here it is in a video:Could we possibly have hit a point where the Republican establishment has finally had it with the monster they created in 2008? Has the NRA and its head idiot, Wayne LaPierre, finally become caricatures of themselves that are too embarrassing even for people like Bill O Reilly and Fox News?Here is something that I never, ever thought I would say in my life: I agree with Bill O Reilly, especially on the part about being paranoid. However, there is one part where Bill just had to veer back into the realm of stupidity so he could throw his audience a bone likely to prevent them from throwing a beer can through their TV screen at home. Bill openly addressed President Obama while saying a firearm registry will not solve America s gun problem.The sudden burst of common sense from Bill couldn t last forever. It is a well documented, checked fact that President Obama does not want to create a gun registry. This was proven when the last universal background check bill completely outlawed the creation of one.Obama s openly accused the NRA of lying about this, from a Rose Garden press conference: They claimed that it would create some sort of big brother gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn t matter. The latest Quinnipiac poll, from December 23, 2015, shows background checks have an absolutely MASSIVE amount of support across the board.Photo: QuinnipiacIt has had this kind of support since after the Sandy Hook massacre, give or take a relatively negligible variance in points, so to act like all of a sudden it is reasonable is strange at best.Regardless of the details, the simple fact that Fox News and Bill O Reilly in particular are siding with President Obama on gun control is nothing short of a noteworthy event in American history.

61,Trump's 'Paterno' comment sparks jeers on social media,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump drew guffaws and derision on social media after he asked a campaign rally in Pittsburgh, How s Joe Paterno? The legendary Penn State University football coach died four years ago. I went to school in this state. I know a lot about Pennsylvania and it s great, Trump said. How s Joe Paterno? We gonna bring that back? How about that whole deal? The term ""Joe Paterno"" quickly became a top trending topic on Twitter, with many asking if Trump knew Paterno was dead. A video clip was posted on YouTube. Paterno, once one of the most revered college athletic coaches in the United States, was fired by Pennsylvania State University in 2011 over a child sexual abuse scandal involving assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. Paterno died on Jan. 21, 2012. Sandusky was later convicted on child sex abuse charges. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the candidate was referring to a statue of Paterno that was removed from the campus in 2012. A Quinnipiac University survey in 2015 showed that many Pennsylvanians want it returned to the campus. Penn State spokesman Ben Manning said on Thursday the university does not comment on candidates campaign speeches. Social media users mocked Trump for seemingly implying that he would bring Paterno back to life. ""Someone should tell Trump that Joe Paterno is dead and also that he conspired with a serial child rapist,"" tweeted kept_simple (@kept_simple). BuzzFeed political editor Katherine Miller (@katherinemiller) tweeted, ""Trump obviously meant when are we going to bring back the Paterno statue and then, subsequently, Paterno back from beyond, through sorcery."" Twitter users with accounts geo-tagged to the university s home, the town of State College, had mixed reactions. ""Bring Paterno back? @realdonaldtrump has odd expectations of his abilities, and responsibilities, as president,"" tweeted Holly Swanson (@StateCollegeMom). Not all reaction was negative. ""All Trump has to do is say he'll bring the Paterno statue back. He'll win PA in a landslide,"" Kalooz (@Kalzony53). Trump had weighed in on the fallout from the Sandusky scandal in July 2012 when the National Collegiate Athletic Association levied sanctions against Penn State s football program. He said in a tweet that the program should be suspended.",FAKE

Greenwald said, The problem is if you look at the last eight years, there has been a very concerted war on not just sources and whistleblowers, but also journalists, implemented by not Donald Trump but by the Obama administration. More sources prosecuted under the 1917 Espionage Act than in all previous administrations combined. Journalists such as James Rosen at Fox News and Jim Risen at The New York Times and those of us who worked on the Snowden reporting constantly threatened with prosecution or having our phone records subpoenaed and the like. And Democratic officeholders in D. C. were virtually unanimous in the idea that people who leak information that s classified are villains, they re traitors, they ought to go to prison, he continued. This framework has been created both rhetorical and legal over the last eight years that says that people who leak classified information regardless of how important that information is ought to be punished. That s the rhetoric and framework that Donald Trump is seizing on.

64,Dallas attack adds to Cleveland concerns before Republican convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Cleveland police on Friday tightened their security plan for the Republican National Convention after the deadly shootings of police officers in Dallas, increasing surveillance and intelligence operations just 10 days before the convention. Other police departments across the country required officers to patrol in pairs rather than alone following the ambush in Dallas, the deadliest day for police in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. In Cleveland, the attack raised another potential threat during the July 18-21 convention, when Donald Trump is expected to receive the Republican nomination for president. The police officers labor union, rank-and-file cops and some outside experts had already questioned Cleveland s preparedness for the convention with the city s police under federal supervision over use of force. Ten days before the event, Cleveland was still training police officers for duty at the convention, which is expected to draw 50,000 visitors as well as clamorous protests and crown the most contentious presidential candidate in memory. Rather than a security team reinforced by the country s largest police departments as it hoped, the city has cobbled together 3,000 officers, mostly from state agencies, who will use borrowed and rented equipment. When the convention was awarded to Cleveland (in 2014), folks weren t thinking about this.... Yes, there is a generalized worry, said Matthew Barge, court-appointed monitor for the U.S. Justice Department s oversight of Cleveland police. Ed Tomba, the city s deputy police chief and head of convention security, had previously told Reuters he was very, very confident in the city s convention plan. He reiterated that confidence in a telephone interview on Friday in response to the Dallas attack. We have got to make some changes without a doubt, Tomba said, mentioning the surveillance of potential threats from street level and farther away. We will have plenty of people watching over different locations. We are beefing up the intelligence component, too. They are going to be very, very active, Tomba said. Police throughout the United States ordered their officers to work in pairs following the shooting in Dallas, including those in New York, Chicago and St. Louis. New York officers will double up on all assignments and auxiliary police officers who are unarmed except for night sticks will not be used in the field for the next few days, Police Commissioner William Bratton told a news conference. St. Louis police also will be required to wear ballistic vests when leaving any station for enforcement activities, Chief Sam Dotson said on Twitter. Tomba said he spent part of Friday morning reassuring out-of-town police departments that their officers on loan to Cleveland will be safe during the convention, telling them in an email that we cannot pull the plan off without them. Cleveland police union President Steve Loomis has been among the most vocal critics, complaining that front-line officers would be undertrained and poorly equipped. They are setting up my guys for failure, Loomis said before the Dallas attack. Civic leaders have said Cleveland is experiencing a renaissance following decades of decline, and that reputation will be on the line during the convention. Two separate incidents of fatal police shootings in recent years have brought unwelcome national attention to the city. In 2012, 13 Cleveland officers fired 137 shots into the car of an unarmed African-American man and his female passenger, killing both. The U.S. Justice Department investigated and imposed special federal oversight known as a consent decree that remains in force. Then in 2014, four months after the Republicans chose Cleveland for the convention, a white police officer shot dead 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was black, in a case that became a national focal point for the protest movement Black Lives Matter. The most recent report from the federal monitor overseeing the Cleveland consent decree portrays a police department where physical infrastructure is strained, with computers and cars run-down or deficient, forcing police to pay for repairs out of their own pockets and use their personal vehicles for police work. Loomis, the union leader, said half of Cleveland police officers have yet to receive convention training. That number is probably close, Tomba said on Thursday. Upon getting the convention, Cleveland asked 200 police departments to send officers, including those from big cities which generally have the best anti-terrorist schooling. Many big cities turned Cleveland down, saying they were unable to spare officers, Tomba said. But Cleveland has exceeded its goal by bringing in 3,000 reinforcements who will receive training at home plus a short course upon arriving, Tomba said.",FAKE
65,Iraqi government asks foreign countries to stop oil trade with Kurdistan,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq on Sunday urged foreign countries to stop importing crude directly from its autonomous Kurdistan region and to restrict oil trading to the central government. The call, published in statement from Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi s office, came in retaliation for the Kurdistan Regional Government s plan to hold a referendum on independence on Monday. The central government s statement seems to be directed primarily at Turkey, the transit country for all the crude produced in Kurdistan. The crude is taken by pipeline to the Turkish Mediterranean coast for export. Baghdad asks the neighboring countries and the countries of the world to deal exclusively with the federal government of Iraq in regards to entry posts and oil, the statement said. The Iraqi government has always opposed independent sales of crude by the KRG, and tried on many occasions to block Kurdish oil shipments. Long-standing disputes over land and oil resources are among the main reasons cited by the KRG to ask for independence. Iraqi Kurdistan produces around 650,000 barrels per day of crude from its fields, including around 150,000 from the disputed areas of Kirkuk. The region s production volumes represent 15 percent of total Iraqi output and around 0.7 percent of global oil production. The KRG aspires to raise production to over 1 million barrels per day by the end of this decade. Kurdish oil production has been dominated by mid-sized oil companies such as Genel (GENL.L), DNO (DNO.OL), Gulf Keystone (GKP.L) and Dana Gas (DANA.AD). Major oil companies such as Chevron (CVX.N), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Rosneft (ROSN.MM) also have projects in Kurdistan but they are mostly at an exploration stage. However, Rosneft, Russia s state oil major, has lent over $1 billion to the KRG guaranteed by oil sales and committed a total of $4 billion to various projects in Kurdistan.",FAKE

67,BLACK LIVES MATTER ORGANIZER Refuses To Meet With Obama And Race Hustlers ¦Calls Meeting At White House: Sham ¦Photo-Op ¦Sound Bite For Obama,"Pure gold The ultimate Race-Baiter-In-Chief, just got called out for the phony that he is. While we re on the topic of Obama pretending to care about the black community, let s talk about how black unemployment has skyrocketed under this fraud Race hustlers Civil rights activists met at the White House on Thursday with President Barack Obama, though a leader from Black Lives Matter, who was listed as an expected attendee, blasted the White House for organizing a photo-op without addressing real problems for minority communities. I could not, with any integrity, participate in such a sham that would only serve to legitimize the false narrative that the government is working to end police brutality and the institutional racism that fuels it, wrote Aislinn Pulley, a leader of Black Lives Matter Chicago who the White House said on Wednesday would be at the meeting.Other attendees included Deshaunya Ware, a student leader of the University of Missouri protest group Concerned Student 1950; Al Sharpton, president of the National Action Network; NAACP President Cornell Brooks; and National Urban League leader Marc Morial.In an op-ed on Truthout, Pulley said she respectfully declined the White House s invitation to attend the panel, which was organized as part of the administration s marking of Black History Month. I was under the impression that a meeting was being organized to facilitate a genuine exchange on the matters facing millions of Black and Brown people in the United States. Instead, what was arranged was basically a photo opportunity and a 90-second sound bite for the president, Pulley wrote.Obama didn t address the absence when he spoke to reporters after the meeting, instead saying he was encouraged by the degree of focus and seriousness and constructiveness that exists not only with existing civil rights organizations but with this new generation. They are some serious young people. I told them they are much better organizers than I was when I was their age. I am confident they will take America to new heights, he said.Later Thursday, a senior administration official said Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and members of the Obama administration had a productive dialogue with civil rights leaders about a range of important issues like the criminal justice system, education, the economy and building trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. We will continue to engage with the many organizations and individuals who chose to participate in this meeting in ongoing discussions about how to strengthen our communities and move our country forward, the official said.Speaking in the White House driveway after meeting with Obama, Sharpton said the group discussed the ongoing fight over naming a replacement for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. He said any GOP-led effort in the Senate to scuttle a presidential Supreme Court nominee would reflect a civil rights violation. To act as if the President is anything less than the President of the United States until January 20, 2017. He cannot be minimized, marginalized or disregarded without doing the same to the American people, Sharpton said.Obama has defended the groups that sprung from high-profile incidents of police killings of unarmed black men. He said in October those communities grievances must be taken seriously, and pushed back on the notion that organizations like Black Lives Matter are anti-police. I think everybody understands all lives matter. I think the reason that the organizers used the phrase Black Lives Matter was not because they were suggesting nobody else s lives matter, Obama said at an event in October. Rather, what they were suggesting was there is a specific problem that s happening in the African-American community that s not happening in other communities and that is a legitimate issue that we ve got to address, he said.

68,A Traumatized Brain That Helped Heal a Broken Heart - The New York Times,"I knew it would be bad the only question was how bad. After waiting outside a surgical ward at Jersey City Medical Center for what seemed like an eternity, the neurosurgeon emerged, introduced herself and explained that blood clots were forming in my husband s brain, a result of multiple fractures to his skull. Even after an extensive operation, internal swelling and pressure on his brain were building to levels inconsistent with life, the doctor explained. To survive the night, he needed another operation. Less than 24 hours earlier, on Dec. 13, 2014, Steve ” my husband and the father of our two young children ” left our Brooklyn apartment for a networking trip in Atlantic City with four colleagues. Throughout the day, he sent me text updates, including a goofy selfie intended to amuse our daughter, then 3 years old. Around 6 a. m. I received a call from two of the colleagues who had been with him in Atlantic City. Steve had been in an accident, they said, and I should call the emergency room. They had been with him all day, but couldn t explain what happened to him. At the hospital, I began to piece together the severity of Steve s condition. The trauma staff members told me that his face was so disfigured and bruised that they had difficulty determining his race. His doctors concluded that he had been assaulted. (The story of his surgery, and the mystery of his injuries, were described in an article in The Atlantic last spring.) After that second brain surgery, his neurosurgeon, Dr. Lauren Schwartz, returned to tell me she had to remove significant chunks of Steve s frontal lobe and temporal lobe ” and that he might not be able to speak or function normally ever again. Even if he managed to emerge from the medically induced coma with his faculties intact, Steve had a long and arduous road ahead, most likely measured in years, with no guarantee that he would return to his former self. Many victims of a brain trauma become overwhelmed by anger, depression and frustration about the slow pace of their recovery and the memory of who they used to be. The severity of Steve s trauma ” and the apparent violence that caused it ” were triggers for those emotions. But after Steve s initial surgeries, I became increasingly confident about his chances for a successful recovery. If I know one absolute truth about my husband, it is that he rises above and exceeds expectations, I wrote in an email to Dr. Schwartz. In retrospect, a reflexive coping mechanism may have been kicking in ” any reasonable analysis should have drastically lowered my expectations. But I believed I had reason for optimism. Steve s brain was engineered to move forward. As a gifted mathematician, he saw the world as a series of equations to be solved. And like an elite athlete, he didn t handicap goals with unhelpful emotions. Steve had been wiring his brain at an early age, partly out of necessity. Raised in a house beset by mental illness, he had to learn to protect himself from harmful emotions and focus on goals. It served him well academically, as he skipped a grade in middle school and went to college at 16. It was a risky social and emotional step for someone so young, but he graduated with honors and was recruited by Goldman Sachs as a programmer. I have always been drawn to his wit and his Olympic reasoning abilities. In an argument, Steve could keep his head while others lost theirs. I didn t always appreciate his economy of emotion. In 2008, when our first child, Sophia, was stillborn at 39 weeks and four days, I carried around her memory, nearly crippled by the weight of the loss. Steve appeared set on moving forward from the very beginning. In the delivery room, I asked Steve to hold Sophia, which he did, but he quickly returned her to the bassinet, seemingly signaling his intent to move on. Over time, my anguish turned to resentment over how he could forge ahead, focus on his work and not share my pain. For years, even when we went on to have two healthy children, I still felt compelled to carry the emotional weight of Sophia s memory. But after Steve s horrific injuries, I knew I had to try to learn to do for my husband what I had been unable do for myself: keep my brain from dwelling on tragedy. Almost two years later, I can still allow myself to become furious about what happened to my husband, still an unsolved mystery. I want to know what happened and who was responsible and have the perpetrators admit their guilt. A part of me wants to linger daily on the unknowns. But Steve inspired me to follow his lead, as I witnessed his unrelenting drive to return to his former self ” and his refusal to be consumed by what happened to him and why. One afternoon, a few days after he awoke from his coma, Steve received a visit from a former colleague he had not seen in more than a decade. Still suffering amnesia, Steve couldn t speak coherently or remember my name. But when his colleague entered the room, Steve s eyes widened. He wiggled upright and offered a handshake. It was a moment I celebrated for days. Weeks later, with parts of his speech returning, Steve made another leap when he gestured for a pen and notepad. He wanted to jot down the conversations he was having with the nursing staff. Jagged lines were all he could manage, but he remained unbowed, asking me to transcribe the conversations regarding his recovery plan. As the pace of Steve s progress accelerated ” in words and movements ” I became consumed with planning for the next steps in his recovery, making arrangements for his rehabilitation, staging our apartment for his return. Looking backward was a luxury I could not afford. When Steve finally came home in early March, every daily event ” going to the grocery store, walking the kids to school, reading the news, listening to our favorite pop songs ” became a learning opportunity, a chance to regain words and memories that had been temporarily lost. At dinner, the kids played word games with Steve, each taking turns to contribute to a category. One evening, when the topic was zoo animals, Steve couldn t locate the word lion. Instead of expressing frustration or embarrassment, he described its color, sound and habitat. When our daughter blurted the answer, Steve s face lit up. Yes, you got it! he shouted, slyly giving the game a new dimension. We were witnessing Steve do what was second nature to him: finding the path forward. Researchers still have a lot to learn about what causes some victims to swiftly recover from brain traumas and others to stall. Steve s doctors marvel that he is doing so well. His determination may have helped. Within 12 months of his trip to Atlantic City, Steve had secured a job as a business analyst with an international bank. Without any visible scars or speech impairments today, he doesn t show any signs of brain trauma. Indeed, even with portions of his brain gone, he has somehow retained his intelligence and career skills, his ability to be a loving husband and father, and the core elements of his identity that let his lifelong habit of looking forward shine through. He s taught me that true tragedy is letting misfortune rob you of the life and love you have. It s a lesson I try to keep in my head as nourishment for my heart.",FAKE
69,U.S. belatedly begins to comply with Russia sanctions law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Thursday said it had belatedly begun informing Congress and others about groups associated with the Russian intelligence and defense sectors as required under a 2017 law tightening sanctions on Russia. The Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which became law on Aug. 2, among other things imposes sanctions on Russia to punish Moscow because U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia carried out a hacking and propaganda campaign to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations. The law calls on the president to impose sanctions on anyone he identifies as having engaged in a significant transaction with a person that is part of, or operates for or on behalf of, the defense or intelligence sectors of the Russian government. The law required the Trump administration to specify the persons that are part of, or operate for or on behalf of, the defense and intelligence sectors of the Russian government by Oct. 1, a deadline the administration missed. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has now authorized the State Department to identify such people or entities, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters. She said notification to Congress, as well as to industry, allies and partners, had begun and that public guidance on the matter would posted on the agency s website soon, although she suggested this would not happen on Thursday. We expect to post the full public guidance on state.gov shortly ... a lot of these conversations are still ongoing between Congress, industry, allies and also partners, Nauert said at a briefing. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker this week said he wanted administration answers about why it failed to meet the deadline for implementing the sanctions on Russia. However, he said he spoke to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan by phone on Thursday and afterward said in a statement that the department s guidance is a good first step in responsibly implementing a very complex piece of legislation.",FAKE
70,Iran Gives Investors Glimpse of $30 Billion in Oil Deals to Come,"Iran is targeting about $30 billion in investment by offering 70 oil and natural gas projects to international companies as the Persian Gulf country anticipates the lifting of economic sanctions.

Iranian officials presented the projects at a two-day conference in Tehran as part of an effort to attract more than $100 billion to revive the energy and petrochemicals industries and generate much-needed government income. Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh introduced them along with a new type of investor contract offering better incentives than the buy-back agreements Iran offered in the past. The work covers 52 production and 18 exploration projects, both onshore and in the Gulf and Caspian Sea.

Iran is offering a negotiable framework for new oil deals rather than a uniform contract for all investors, Roknoddin Javadi, managing director at National Iranian Oil Co., said Saturday in Tehran. The government may modify the framework and plans to present more details in February at a conference in London, Seyed Mehdi Hosseini, chairman of the ministry s Oil Contract Restructuring Committee, said Sunday in an interview.

Here are five things to know about this turning point in Iran s campaign to upgrade its energy industry:

* The new investor contract will give companies a share of the oil they produce and let them sell it globally, Hosseini said in Tehran. International companies will be paid in cash or in kind based on a fee per barrel, Talin Mansourian, a consultant with Hosseini s committee, said Saturday. Iran would reduce the fee if oil prices fell by more than 50 percent and increase it if prices rose by a corresponding amount, Mansourian said.

Iran s old buy-back deals paid companies a fixed fee regardless of how much oil they produced and offered them no incentive to exceed output targets. Buy-backs also paid no compensation to companies that spent more than budgeted amounts to develop a field.

Under the new contracts, the NIOC won t limit capital spending and will approve budgets on a yearly basis, though companies still won t receive a higher fee if they produce above their output targets, Hosseini said.

* The new contracts will be valid for 20 years, with possible extensions to 25 years. Buy-back agreements were limited to seven years, which wasn t enough time for companies to make adequate returns on their investments, Total SA Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said last month in Abu Dhabi.

Investors should be able to recover their development costs five to seven years after starting production, according to Iranian officials. Companies that come up empty-handed after exploring for oil or gas can search for fuel in nearby areas. Under buy-backs, they had to stick to development plans agreed upon before work began and were barred from exploring new areas.

* Companies will be able to negotiate directly for some contracts, and Iran could sign its first deal as early as March or April, Hosseini said. Iran won t allow foreign companies to escape their contractual obligations if the U.S. or another party re-imposes unilateral sanctions, said Seyed Mostafa Zeynoddin, an adviser to the committee. If the UN restores sanctions, a company could claim force majeure if unable to execute a contract, he said.

* International investors must team up with local partners that the Iranian government selects, and they can t own hydrocarbon deposits. Iran will let international and local companies determine the stakes each will hold in joint-ventures formed to develop fields.

* Iran is preparing to start the bidding process for oil and gas rights by the next Iranian calendar year starting March 21. Companies will be asked to make bids based on a per-barrel development fee, Mansourian said. NIOC will announce other terms when it starts the tendering process in four to five months, she said.",FAKE
71,BREAKING: OBAMA SUCCESSFULLY WHITEWASHES AMERICAN HISTORY ¦ Racist President Andrew Jackson To Be Replaced With Harriet Tubman On $20 Bill,"The irony in Obama s radical Treasury Secretary s decision to remove racist Andrew Jackson from the $20 bill, lies in the fact that Jackson was the first Democrat to be elected President. Rabid Bernie Sanders supporters are hell-bent on seeing Bernie Sanders fulfill his promise of breaking up the big bank monopolies. Andrew Jackson was pioneer in staving off banking domination in his day.But alas it s official .Moments ago Politico reported that the U.S. Treasury will announce that it plans to replace former President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill with Harriet Tubman, the sources said. There will also be changes to the $5 bill to depict civil rights era leaders.Not every dead president is being scraped however: treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Wednesday will announce a decision to keep Alexander Hamilton on the front of the $10 bill and put leaders of the movement to give women the right to vote on the back of the bill.Lew s decision comes after he announced last summer that he was considering replacing Hamilton on the $10 bill with a woman. The announcement drew swift rebukes from fans of Hamilton, who helped create the Treasury Department and the modern American financial system. Critics immediately suggested Hamilton take Jackson off the $20 bill given the former president s role in moving native Americans off their land.Jackson may remain on the $20 bill in some capacity, but will clearly be demoted.While some pointed to the many accomplishments and qualities of Hamilton for why he should stay on the currency printed by the very Treasury the man created, the more popular argument for the Founding Father s retention was an argument about how awful the man on the $20 dollar bill was.The Daily Beast described Jackson as villainous and linked to a February article that called him a mass murderer. The New York Post argued that Old Hickory may well have been our most racist president and was a vicious, power-mad kook. Lew told POLITICO last July that Treasury was exploring ways to respond to critics. There are a number of options of how we can resolve this, Lew said. We re not taking Alexander Hamilton off our currency. Confused? Disturbed? Angry? You are not alone. The following rant by Mac Slavo expressed many feeling about the proposed change.Andrew Jackson, Who Fought Central Bank, Removed from $20 As Public Concern for Liberty ErasedJackson narrowly succeeded in staving off banker domination of the U.S. during his day.Of course, Andrew Jackson, who was the United States seventh president, was also a complete controversy his entire lifetime. It is no surprise that the same people who took down the Confederate flag from the South on the back of a mass shooting tragedy are now trying to tear down the image of a particularly controversial and intriguing figure from the American past.Jackson was a recalcitrant and unyielding general and war hero, and later an outsider riding a wave of populist support into the White House, bringing in sometimes unscrupulous companions, and plenty of Masons. Many of his backers were diametrically opposed to the entrenched power of New York bankers and speculators, as well as patrician politicians who dominated the first phase of politics in the nation s history. Jackson played a nasty role in the Trail of Tears affairs with Indians, too, and with the South and Western expansion of slave-friendly territories. Many shades of grey.Erasing Andrew Jackson from the faces of the fiat funny-money that is passed around by an increasingly ignorant and dependent society (which itself has adopted digital currency as the new norm) will further cut off the past from the masses, and ensure their enslavement.For entire story: Zero Hedge",REAL

73,Christian Pastor Jailed by Iran Reveals STUNNING Truth About Trump,"You are here: Home / US / Christian Pastor Jailed by Iran Reveals STUNNING Truth About Trump Christian Pastor Jailed by Iran Reveals STUNNING Truth About Trump October 29, 2016 Pinterest 
Christian pastor Saeed Abedini was jailed in Iran because of his faith for three and a half years. During that extremely difficult time, Abedini said that GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump met with his family and gave them $10,000. 
Abedini wrote about how Trump helped his family in a recent Facebook post and noted that he had already voted for Trump last week in early voting. I am finally free in a free country, he wrote. Last year on the same day I was sick and in chains for Christ, and now I can vote to choose my next president. 
And most amazingly, I can vote for someone that I know fought for me and called my name so many times. He met my family and gave them a $10,000 gift. I think his ideas are more biblical than the other candidates. 
In contrast, Clinton did nothing for him or his family: 
As a woman who says she stands for women s rights when she was foreign minister, she never contacted my mom, wife, sister or my daughter. She never did anything to help when I was in prison as an American pastor who was detained in Iran as a hostage. 
Christian Today reported : 
Abedini strongly defended Trump from attacks on his character, saying God used flawed men to lead nations in the Old Testament, likening him to King Cyrus of Persia, a figure mentioned more than 30 times in the Bible. According to Bible experts, Cyrus was a great pagan king who ruled Persia from 539 to 530 B.C. Under his rule, Jews were first allowed to return to Israel after 70 years of captivity. 
Abedini wrote: 
In the past few months, we have seen how media is attacking Donald Trump s past. I have even heard so many people said he is not a Christian. Of course, only God knows this for sure, but what I see is God is using him and anointed him. It seems to me that he is the Cyrus of our modern day, but like you and me, he is a flawed man, in the process of spiritual growth. 
When we hear that this candidate or that candidate is not a strong Christian or has a past that disqualifies him to be the President of the United States, my answer is that we are a nation, a people who are also sinners, saved by grace. 
How often do you hear about kind things Clinton has done for others like this? I can t think of any. Abedini s words are extremely powerful and certainly something anyone who is on the fence about Trump should read.",REAL

78,South Korea's Moon unveils new focus on Southeast Asia,"BOGOR, Indonesia (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday unveiled a new policy aimed at deepening ties with Southeast Asia, as the North Asian economic powerhouse seeks to curb its reliance on traditional trading partners like China and the United States. Moon made Indonesia, Southeast Asia s biggest economy, his first state visit to the region and was accompanied by a delegation of around 200 business leaders. The New Southern Policy aims to better connect South Korea to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping and expand the economic influence of Asia s fourth-largest economy in the region home to more than half a billion people. Korean diplomacy in Asia has been more toward Japan, China and Russia. But I see that it should expand to new horizons, Moon told a business forum in Jakarta, where he pledged to dramatically strengthen cooperation with ASEAN . South Korea s presidential Blue House has said the policy will mirror Moon s New Northern Policy aimed at expanding cooperation with China, Japan, Russia, and Mongolia. Indonesia and South Korea signed on Thursday a memorandum of understanding on a light rail transit (LRT) system in Jakarta, part of a series of pacts reported to be worth up to $1.9 billion. A recent year-long diplomatic standoff between Seoul and Beijing over the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system has exposed the dependence of Korean companies on Chinese customers and likely exacerbated Seoul s urgency to diversify ties. During a joint news conference with U.S. President Donald Trump this week, Moon said he was aiming for a more balanced diplomacy, which would include Russia, ASEAN countries, and members of the European Union. Moon held talks with Indonesian President Joko Widodo at a state palace in Bogor, south of Jakarta, and discussed infrastructure, trade, and also tension on the Korean peninsula. I appreciate President Moon s position that he remains open to resolving any disputes through dialogue, Widodo told a news conference in the Dutch colonial-style palace. Indonesia has traditionally had good relations with North Korea and maintains diplomatic ties and is one of a small number of countries with an embassy in Pyongyang. A number of South Korean companies already have or are planning big investments in Indonesia. Steel giant POSCO has a multi-billion-dollar joint venture with Indonesia s Krakatau Steel, Hyundai Motor is setting up a car factory, and Samsung Electronics Co assembles smartphones in the country. Indonesia is also emerging as an important market for South Korean defense equipment and the countries are cooperating on a venture to jointly build a fighter plane, dubbed KF-X. Moon said South Korea aimed to boost trade with Indonesia to $30 billion by 2022 and eventually to more than $50 billion. Trade between the countries was worth about $10 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up nearly a fifth from the corresponding 2016 period. Korean foreign direct investment rose about a quarter to $1.37 billion. Both leaders said the relationship between the countries had been redefined as a Special Strategic Partnership . South Koreans make up one of Indonesia s largest expatriate groups, with numerous Korean restaurants and bars in parts of Jakarta. Besides corporate muscle, Korea s soft power has also grown in Indonesia alongside other countries in Southeast Asia. Korean K-Pop is hugely popular among Indonesians, with long-established fan clubs and bands, like BTS, touring the Southeast Asian country. Indonesian Twitter accounts dedicated to Korean pop idols have around a million followers.",FAKE

Facebook | Twitter November 23, 2016 Manosphere 
There are those who think we should only get our news from official sources. You know, like the blonde telling you what to believe in between hocking a hockey game. 
If there s anything the 2016 election showed us, it s that the American people are increasingly distrustful of and not listening to the commands laid out by the once mainstream media. They re increasingly reticent to commit national and demographic suicide under the guise of diversity and other nebulous ideals. They re desperate not only to drain the swamp but to restore some sense of national pride and stability to the declining USA. 
In response, the controllers of the presstitutes (the people who really run the world) are already hard at work trying to find some way to create a false narrative about fake news sites in order to lay the ground work for censorship and control. The Internet has all but destroyed the corporate-government narrative, and there is a shit fit happening at the highest levels of the propaganda ministry (i.e. CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, et. al.) because they have learned the American people know how full of shit they really are. 
Sites like Return Of Kings are on the front lines of this war in support of free speech and it is vitally important we stay on top of our game to avoid a reversion to the managed propaganda the centralized control of mass media gave us over the last 50 years. Hackers and leakers play right into the hands of the censorship narrative 
Make no mistake, one of the reasons leakers of misdeeds done by politicians and the elite they work for have been allowed to continue leaking dirty laundry is because it plays into the hands of those with designs on censorship and re-gaining control of the information the sheeple get to listen to. Having Julian Assange and Edward Snowden doing leaks of information and giving them extensive press coverage plays right into the hands of the censorship brigade because they can also play the protecting national security game when the time to silence dissent comes . 
Fake news is only the first assault in what is sure to become a full scale war on free speech on the Internet. We can be thankful Trump won the election rather than The Bitch since his election will slow the process of censorship, but the aggressiveness of the fake news narrative shows us how determined some people are to shut us up and shut us down. 
The New York Times is already on the front lines of this assault on free speech on the Internet. Only days after The Bitch lost the election, publisher Arthur Sulzberger published a Mea Culpa and promised to rededicate the newspaper to honest reporting. 
We cannot deliver the independent, original journalism for which we are known without the loyalty of our subscribers ¦ [The New York Times promises to] give the news impartially, without fear or favor ¦ We also approach the incoming Trump administration without bias. 
Don t buy into it. This is what s known in Public Relations as a diversion tactic. While we focus on our seeming victory, they re already moving on to their next false narrative “ so-called fake news. No sooner than the ink dried on the promise to give Trump a chance, The New York Times was moving to shut up the very people who made possible his rise to power “ the alt-right and alternative news web sites. 
While some fake news is produced purposefully by teenagers in the Balkans or entrepreneurs in the United States seeking to make money from advertising, false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere. 
They did a spurious case study on how a rumor got started about protesters being bussed in to protest at Trump rallies. Never mind the mainstream media is a business that runs lock, stock and barrel on fake news. Almost every narrative they create is a false one. One need do no more than a Google search to discredit many, if not most of the mainstream media s stories. The hypocrisy is astounding. Pulling The Plug Facebook censorship algorithms are nothing compared to the elite s agenda of eliminating free speech online 
Whether or not the fake news narrative gains traction, the next step will be for the elite to create a problem that affects millions of people online, then follow through with the Hegelian Dialectic with a pre-ordained solution to make everyone safer online and to stop the spread of false information while protecting free speech online by destroying it. 
Look for no less than a figurative Internet 9/11 if the elite become desperate enough. 
They ll pull the plug on the backbone of the Internet, shutting down e-commerce and communication online for a few days, blame it on a fake news story (just like Benghazi was blamed on a YouTube video) then spring in to save us from ourselves by passing all sorts of creative laws and restrictions aimed at nothing more than eliminating competition to the corporate-government narrative and gutting yet another of our Bill of Rights protections. 
Make no mistake, Freedom of Speech is the most important of Amendments to the Constitution. Once that is taken away, it s Game Over. Obama has already floated the idea of silencing those of us who cling to our guns and religion and continues this narrative even after the election of Trump 
Obama has already been floating the idea of official news web sites. This is nothing more than proposing the creation of the American equivalent of Pravda in the Soviet Union, in which only the state-approved newspaper was considered the truth and everything else was considered lies. Obviously, the New World Order socialist narrative would be the only truth under a system such as this, and traditional and conservative views would be relentlessly silenced 
Check out what The Messiah said in Berlin recently. 
In an age where there s so much active misinformation, and it s packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television, where some overzealousness on the part of a US official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won t know what to protect. If we can t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems. 
The fact he is saying these things should frighten you. It should also make you angry. This statement is a PC way of saying the goal of the power structure is to shut us the fuck up. They want us to listen to clueless journalists who encourage the idea of microchipping your children and later, yourselves so every aspect of your life can be controlled by the government. 
We must fight back by discrediting the fake news narrative at every turn and informing those who will listen of the possibility of a fake Internet 9/11 designed to give the government a reason to curb free expression on the very Libertarian Internet of today.",REAL
81,"New York, other states challenge Trump over climate change regulation","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of 17 U.S. states filed a legal challenge on Wednesday against efforts by President Donald Trump s administration to roll back climate change regulations, deepening a political rift over his emerging energy policies. Led by New York state, the coalition said the administration has a legal duty to regulate emissions of the gases scientists believe cause global climate change. The law is clear: the EPA must limit carbon pollution from power plants, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement announcing the challenge. Trump signed an executive order last week targeting climate change regulations ushered in by former President Barack Obama, saying they hinder U.S. energy production and jobs without providing meaningful environmental benefits. The order s main target was Obama s Clean Power Plan, a law that would require states to slash carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, but which was never implemented because it was challenged in court by 26 Republican-led states. Trump s order directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review the regulation to decide whether to suspend, rescind, or revise it. Shortly after, EPA filed a legal motion asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to delay ongoing court proceedings on the regulation to allow for the review. The New York-led coalition s motion on Wednesday asked the court to throw out the EPA s request to delay court proceedings, saying the delay would waste the substantial resources already expended in this litigation. This case is ripe for decision now, and nothing that EPA has proposed to do obviates the need for this court s review, according to the statement. The coalition includes attorneys general from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington - along with the District of Columbia and a number of smaller localities.",FAKE
82,Trump vows to stay in race after lewd remarks surface,"(Editors Note: Attention language that may be offensive to some readers in paragraphs 22, 23, 24) By Emily Stephenson and Ginger Gibson NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With his campaign in crisis, U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump vowed on Saturday to stay in the race despite calls from more than two dozen prominent Republicans for him to drop out following the release of a recording of him making lewd comments about women. Both Trump s wife and his running mate criticized his words, saying they were insulting and indefensible. The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! Trump wrote on Saturday afternoon on the social media website Twitter. The video was the latest calamity for Trump, who had hoped to revive his flagging campaign in the face of a recent drop in polls with less than a month until Election Day. Trump is due to appear alongside Democrat Hillary Clinton on Sunday in their second debate in the run-up to the general election. Clinton is not expected to address Trump s video before then. The 2005 video of Trump talking on an open microphone showed the then-reality TV star speaking about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania. In a statement, Melania Trump called her husband s words unacceptable and offensive to me. This does not represent the man that I know, she said. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world. The backlash over the video was swift and widespread. More than 60 prominent Republican current and former officeholders issued statements condemning Trump s remarks about women, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and John McCain, the party s standard bearer in 2008. More than 20 called for Trump to end his presidential bid. In an unusual move, his vice presidential running mate Mike Pence issued a critical statement of Trump s words, saying on Twitter that he cannot defend them. As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump, said Pence, who is governor of Indiana. Pence indicated he would continue to support Trump, despite calls from several Republicans for Trump to step aside and let Pence be the nominee. There is no precedent for a major party to replace its nominee this late in the campaign and it was unclear if there was an avenue to force him out. Voting has begun in several states, including swing states Virginia and North Carolina. A recorded apology by Trump early on Saturday did not stymie an avalanche of calls from members of his party to quit. Trump huddled on Saturday in Trump Tower with senior advisers, including New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Despite previous scheduling, Giuliani will appear on five major Sunday morning news programs, a rare round robin reserved for major news events - replacing Republican Chairman Reince Priebus on CBS s Face the Nation and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on Fox News Sunday, a last-minute switch. No reason was given for the bump of Conway. A CBS news release said the RNC asked to replace Priebus because Trump s operation wanted a campaign person to appear on the program. Trump left the building briefly to greet a small crowd of supporters, saying 100 percent he would remain in the race. Before returning to a bank of elevators, he told reporters, Tremendous support. He quickly moved to do damage control in Saturday s video in which he declared himself a changed man and attempted to shift the focus to his opponent Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. On Twitter, Trump posted critical statements from Juanita Broaddrick, a woman who has accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting her. Anyone who knows me knows these words don t reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize, Trump said in his video statement, posted on his Facebook page. Trump has struggled to win over women voters, and the video was expected to further feed Democratic criticism about his past behavior toward women. Trump s support has suffered among suburban women and white, college-educated women, groups that Republicans have traditionally won. In the recording that triggered the firestorm, Trump said of one woman, I did try and fuck her. She was married. He went on to discuss his attraction to others. I just start kissing them, he said. And when you re a star they let you do it. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything, Trump said. On Saturday afternoon, CNN published a separate report detailing remarks Trump made over the course of several years while appearing on Howard Stern s radio program. The remarks included discussing the size of his daughter s breasts and that he once had sex with three women at the same time. Trump was asked if he would have sex with a black woman and responded, It depends on what your definition of black is. The remarks were the last straw for some Republicans who have stuck with him through a series of controversial remarks, including calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, calling for a ban on Muslim immigrants, attacking a judge of Mexican descent, attacking the Gold Star family of a Muslim soldier killed at war and saying Senator John McCain was not a war hero because he had been a prisoner of war. House Speaker Paul Ryan disinvited Trump to a scheduled appearance on Saturday in Wisconsin. Pence declined to speak in his place. The list of Republicans announcing they would not vote for Trump or calling on him to step aside grew on Saturday: Senators Kelly Ayotte, Lisa Murkowsi, Dan Sullivan, Mark Kirk, Jeff Flake, John Thune, Mike Crapo, Shelley Moore Capito and Mike Lee; House members Jason Chaffetz, Mia Love, Joe Heck, Bradley Byrne, Martha Roby and Barbara Comstock; and Governors John Kasich, Dennis Daugaard and Gary Herbert. Additionally, former presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Carly Fiorina and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called on Trump to quit. Donald Trump s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy, McCain said in a statement. While Democrats largely remained silent, opting to let Republicans attack one of their own, Vice President Joe Biden wrote on Twitter, The words are demeaning. Such behavior is an abuse of power. It s not lewd. It s sexual assault. Some prominent Republicans indicated they would stick with Trump. Ralph Reed, head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, and Tony Perkins, head of the conservative Family Research Council, said they would continue to support him. I think 10 years ago he was a different man, said Representative Jack Kingston, a Republican from Georgia. I am very glad that he quickly apologized.",FAKE

Two of Al Qaeda s former explosives experts were just transferred out of Guantanamo Bay and sent to Senegal, the Defense Department confirmed Monday, marking the latest detainees to be shipped out of the prison camp despite the risk they could return to the battlefield.The two Libyan former detainees were separately listed as threats to U.S. interests in Department of Defense documents obtained by Wikileaks and The New York Times.Salem Abdu Salam Ghereby is believed to have fought coalition forces at Usama bin Laden s Tora Bora complex in Afghanistan and was associated with senior members of Al Qaeda. Omar Khalif Mohammed Abu Baker Major Umar was assessed to be likely to immediately seek out prior associates and reengage in hostilities and extremist support activities upon his release, according to a 2008 government document.The news comes as senators prepare to introduce legislation to permanently block transfers of Guantanamo detainees to terror hot spots and state sponsors of terrorism including Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran and Sudan. Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., was expected to introduce a bill as early as Monday, Fox News has learned.The transfer of Ghereby and Umar reduces the Guantanamo detainee population to 89, according to the Department of Defense. They are part of the Obama administration s long-running and controversial effort to reduce the prison population and ultimately close the camp.By law, the Pentagon must notify Congress 30 days in advance of any detainee transfer. The first notification for the individuals now identified as Ghereby and Umar was in early March. Others are expected in the next few weeks. We are taking all possible steps to reduce the detainee population at Guantanamo and to close the detention facility in a responsible manner that protects our national security, Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement on Monday.Via: FOX News",REAL

86,You ll Never Guess Which Conservative Blowhard Compared Trump To Hitler (VIDEO),"As you re probably aware already, Donald Trump released an Instagram video this past week in which he attacks Bill Clinton s embattled sex life while tarring Hillary Clinton as being a women s rights hypocrite for remaining married to Bill.Insane.It only gets more insane when the video shows Hillary and Bill flanked by another Bill Bill Cosby.On Thursday night s edition of The O Reilly Factor, yet another Bill Bill O Reilly along with former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino, reviewed the video. At the tail end of the segment, O Reilly said something that ought to shock everyone.O Reilly said to Perino, [B]y making Hillary Clinton the focus, and this ad that we re going to show you features Cosby, Monica Lewinsky. O Reilly continued, You know, I don t know if Hitler made it, but you know, he might have. It s crazy. So, yes, Bill O Reilly just compared Donald Trump to Hitler. Frankly, I don t quite know how to feel about this. On one had, O Reilly violated Godwin s Law by invoking Hitler during a political discussion.On the other hand, O Reilly isn t totally wrong. Obviously, there s only one Hitler, and I ve resisted the urge to go there, but the ad is classic propaganda, the likes of which the Nazi regime perfected during its terrible reign. Maybe the compromise is Joseph Goebbels, Hitler s minister of propaganda. But we re still in Godwin s territory.Then again, if a prominent conservative wants to give the Democrats a big chunk of excellent video for a future commercial, I m all for it. If the Democrats haven t archived this clip for a series of ads, and perhaps sent a letter to O Reilly, thanking him for the easy win, they re insane. This ought to play in pro-Hillary or pro-Bernie ads from now until November. Thanks, O Reilly.Via Media Matters: Featured image via Twitter",REAL
87,"ISIS SUPPORTER RESPONDS TO KILLING OF TOP ISIS OPERATIVE: If they took Abu Sayyaf, we will take Obama","A JV team threat Shaken by a daring U.S. military strike deep in ISIS territory, supporters of the extremist organization were vowing revenge for the killing of senior leader Abu Sayyaf or claiming the special operations mission never took place, a Vocativ analysis reveals. If they took Abu Sayyaf, we will take Obama, one ISIS supporter posted in the hours after the raid near the eastern Syrian city of al-Amr.Translation: If your goal is killing Abu Sayyaf then our goal is killing Obama and the worshipers of the cross. We have attacks coming against you.Elite American commandos carried out the rare, overnight military operation, killing Sayyaf, capturing his wife, and freeing a Yezidi woman believed to have been held as their slave, the Pentagon said Saturday. Defense Secretary Ash Carter heralded the mission as a significant blow to the Islamic State.Vocativ analyzed social media across Syria in the wake of the strike and discovered some ISIS supporters claimed the news was U.S. propaganda timed to counter ISIS momentum after taking most of the Iraqi city of Ramadi this week. Others tweeted from outside the Syrian city of Raqqa vowing revenge for the strike, saying they heard explosions and helicopters.Carter said Sayyaf was responsible for directing many of the group s military activities and funding, directing its illicit oil, gas, and financial operation. No U.S. forces were killed or injured during the operation, which represented another significant blow to the group, Carter said. And it is a reminder that the United States will never waver in denying safe haven to terrorists who threaten our citizens, and those of our friends and allies, he continued in the statement.The mission included the arrest of Sayyaf s wife, Umm Sayyaf, and the freeing of the Yezidi woman. The trading of Yezidi women has been a major inducement and reward for ISIS fighters in the past. The Yezidis follow a strand of Islam that is rejected by mainstream Muslims as heretical. ISIS last year surrounded the Yezidis villages in northern Iraq, killing and capturing dozens, and taking many of the girls and women as slaves. U.S. forces captured Umm Sayyaf, who we suspect is a member of ISIS, played an important role in ISIS s terrorist activities, and may have been complicit in what appears to have been the enslavement of a young Yezidi woman rescued last night, Carter said. The White House said in a statement that Umm Sayyaf had been moved to a U.S. military detention facility in Iraq. The Yezidi woman would be freed. We intend to reunite her with her family as soon as feasible, Bernadette Meehan, the National Security Council spokeswoman, said in a statement.The operation was coordinated with Iraqi officials, but the U.S. government did not coordinate with the Syrian regime, nor did we advise them in advance of this operation, Ms. Meehan said.According to reports, a team of the Army s Delta Force troops traveled in Black Hawk helicopters and Osprey aircraft into al-Amr in eastern Syria. The Washington Post quoted an unnamed defense official who said a firefight broke out after the troops touched down near a building where Abu Sayyaf was believed to be, and that ISIS fighters tried to use women and children as human shields. It was a real fight, the official told the Post, saying there was hand-to-hand fighting and about a dozen militants were killed. He told the Post that troops collected items that might prove useful intelligence.Via: Vocativ.com",REAL
88,U.S. top court takes up Republican challenge to Maryland electoral district,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday added a second case to its docket on a contentious issue that could have major consequences for American elections, agreeing to decide whether Democratic lawmakers in Maryland unlawfully drew a congressional district in a way that would prevent a Republican candidate from winning. The court s agreement to take up an appeal by Republican voters in Maryland regarding the U.S. House of Representatives district came two months after the justices heard arguments in a high-profile challenge by Democratic voters to Republican-drawn state legislative districts in Wisconsin. Both cases target a practice known as partisan gerrymandering that aims to entrench one party in power and that critics have called a distortion of the democratic process. The justices have not yet issued a ruling in the Wisconsin case. Each case presents a different legal theory as to why limits should be placed on partisan gerrymandering, and the court s decision to take up a second case on the issue hints that at least some of the nine justices are seriously considering cracking down on it. Gerrymandering, a practice dating back two centuries in American politics, involves manipulating boundaries of legislative districts to benefit one party and diminish another. Legislative districts around the United States are redrawn every decade after the national census to reflect population changes. The redistricting in most states is done by the party in power though some states assign the task to independent commissions. The Supreme Court for decades has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination but never those drawn simply for partisan advantage. In the Maryland case, the Republican voters targeting the Democratic-drawn electoral map appealed a 2-1 ruling in August by a panel of three federal judges sitting in Baltimore rejecting their challenge. Maryland s sixth congressional district, the focus of the case, was previously held by a Republican and now is held by Democrat John Delaney. When the Supreme Court heard arguments in the Wisconsin case on Oct. 3, the justices appeared closely divided, with conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy likely to cast the deciding vote. The Republican challengers in Maryland take aim at a single electoral district, not the whole state as in the Wisconsin case. They argue that the district should be struck down because it was drawn by Democrats as a form of retaliation on the basis of past party affiliation based on the Constitution s guaranteed rights of free association and free speech. The challengers in the Wisconsin case argued that the Republican electoral map violated Democratic voters rights to equal protection under the law as well as free speech and association. In the Wisconsin case, the legal argument advanced by the Democratic challengers was that an electoral map would be unlawful if the intent was to discriminate against minority party voters, the map had a sizable effect in accomplishing that goal and that there was no other justification for the map. The theory was based in part on measuring the number of wasted votes in each district cast for a losing candidate and comparing each party s total wasted votes on a statewide basis. The results, plaintiffs said, show whether one party s votes are more likely to be wasted than the other party s, which would show evidence of unconstitutional extreme partisan gerrymandering.",FAKE
89,Ukraine Lawmaker Who Worked With Trump Associates Faces Treason Inquiry - The New York Times,"Prosecutors in Ukraine are investigating whether a member of Parliament committed treason by working with two associates of President Trump s to promote a plan for settling Ukraine s conflicts with Russia. In a court filing on Tuesday, prosecutors accused the lawmaker, Andrii V. Artemenko, of conspiring with Russia to commit subversive acts against Ukraine, in particular by advancing a proposal that could legitimize the temporary occupation of the Crimean peninsula. Russia forcibly annexed the peninsula in 2014, a step that Ukraine, the United States and other governments have refused to recognize Mr. Artemenko said his proposal would allow Ukraine to formally cede control of the territory to Russia, at least temporarily. Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine s prosecutor general, posted a copy of the court filing to his Facebook page on Tuesday with the statement Ukraine s integrity is above all else. Mr. Artemenko s plan, reported on Sunday by The New York Times, outlines a series of steps meant to bring to an end the rebellion by separatists in eastern Ukraine, and to resolve the dispute over Crimea by allowing voters to decide whether to lease the peninsula to Russia for 50 or 100 years. Settling those issues could give the Trump administration a path to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Artemenko traveled to New York in January to discuss the plan with Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump s personal lawyer, and with Felix H. Sater, a business associate of the Trump Organization who scouted business opportunities in Russia for the company as recently as 2015. Mr. Cohen said he delivered the proposal to the White House in a sealed envelope in early February. Mr. Artemenko, a politician who has tried to brand himself as a populist, has not been arrested or formally charged with a crime. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Ukrainian news outlet Strana. ua quoted him as saying that the investigation was politically motivated. I m not going anywhere, and will meet with investigators to explain my position, he was quoted as saying. Mr. Artemenko has claimed he received encouragement from the Russian authorities for his effort, but the Kremlin has denied any knowledge of his proposal. He has also claimed to have evidence of corruption that could help lead to the ouster of the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals concerning the war in Ukraine, which has cost more than 10, 000 lives. White House officials have suggested that they would be open to lifting sanctions against Russia, but they have also demanded that Crimea be returned to Ukraine. Word of Mr. Artemenko s peace plan has prompted outrage among many officials in Ukraine. Some accused him of being a secret Russian agent, and there have been calls for him to relinquish his seat in Parliament. On Monday, fellow Radical Party lawmakers voted unanimously to expel him from the party. The suggestion that Crimea be handed over to Russia legally, even for a limited time, particularly outraged Crimean Tatars, the ethnic group in Ukraine whose members consider the peninsula their historic homeland. Refat Chubarov, a Tatar member of Parliament, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Artemenko should be stripped of his parliamentary immunity and arrested. Given the continued Russian occupation of Crimea, he wrote, which is characterized by the total suppression of the rights and freedoms of the Crimea Tatar people violent kidnappings and killings of peaceful citizens arrests of Crimean Tatar citizens and attacks on their homes and families as well as the persecution of journalists, the actions of Andrii Artemenko are unequivocally qualified as treason.",FAKE

91,Trump s F.C.C. Pick Quickly Targets Net Neutrality Rules - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON ” In his first days as President Trump s pick to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai has aggressively moved to roll back consumer protection regulations created during the Obama presidency. Mr. Pai took a first swipe at net neutrality rules designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet. He stopped nine companies from providing discounted internet service to individuals. He withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down, and he scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market. In total, as the chairman of the F. C. C. Mr. Pai released about a dozen actions in the last week, many buried in the agency s website and not publicly announced, stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts. They said Mr. Pai s message was clear: The F. C. C. an independent agency, will mirror the Trump administration s rapid unwinding of government regulations that businesses fought against during the Obama administration. With these tactics, Chairman Pai is showing his true stripes, said Matt Wood, the policy director at the consumer group Free Press. The public wants an F. C. C. that helps people, he added. Instead, it got one that does favors for the powerful corporations that its chairman used to work for. Mr. Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, was elevated by Mr. Trump to the position of chairman after serving as a minority Republican member for the past three years. Known for being a stickler on conservative interpretations of telecommunications law and the limits of the F. C. C. s authority, Mr. Pai said he was trying to wipe the slate clean. He noted that his predecessor, Tom Wheeler, had rammed through a series of actions right after the presidential election. Many of those efforts, Mr. Pai argued, went beyond the agency s legal authority. These actions, which did not enjoy the support of the majority of commissioners at the time they were taken, should not bind us going forward, Mr. Pai said in a statement released Friday. Accordingly, they are being revoked. The efforts portend great changes at the federal agency at the center of the convergence of media, telecommunications and the internet. The biggest target will be net neutrality, a rule created in 2015 that prevents internet service providers from blocking or discriminating against internet traffic. The rule, which was created alongside a decision to categorize broadband like a utility, was the tech centerpiece of the Obama administration. On Friday, the F. C. C. took its first steps to pull back those rules, analysts said. Mr. Pai closed an investigation into practices of the wireless providers ATT and Verizon. is the offering of free streaming and other downloads that do not count against limits on the amount of data a consumer can download. If a provider like ATT offers free streaming of its DirecTV programs, does that violate net neutrality rules because it could put competing video services at a disadvantage? Under its previous leadership, the F. C. C. said in a report that it saw some evidence that made it concerned. But Mr. Pai said after closing the investigations into wireless carriers that was popular among consumers, particularly households. The speed of the ruling and the chairman s tone are very encouraging for internet service providers, said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen. I think it s a down payment on net neutrality, with much more to follow. Last week, Mr. Pai said he disagreed with the move two years ago to declare broadband a utility. The reclassification of broadband into a service akin to telephones and electricity provided the legal foundation for net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai said he had not decided how he would approach the overhaul of broadband classification and net neutrality rules, but he faces legal hurdles. A federal court upheld the rules last year, and the commission could end up in a lengthy legal battle if he tries to scrap the rules. Mr. Pai will have the help of powerful members of Congress who have promised to attack the classification of broadband as a service. And he is popular among Republican leaders, including the Senate s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who with other members viewed Mr. Pai as a loyal voice of dissent during the Obama years. Mr. Pai, 44, the child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, is a fresh face for the Republican Party. Congress could introduce legislation that limits the agency s ability to regulate broadband providers and enforce net neutrality rules. Also under attack are privacy rules for broadband providers. The agency has strayed from its core mission, said Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative from Tennessee who oversees a telecommunications and tech subcommittee. She has called for a hearing within two weeks on the F. C. C. agenda under the new administration. Democrats in Congress said they would fight legislation that waters down net neutrality rules. They said Mr. Pai, described as a student of telecom law, would be a tough adversary, and they face great opposition from Republicans who have promised to prioritize the overturning of net neutrality rules. The key here is that it s already been tested in the courts and the court upheld this, said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California. Ajit Pai is intelligent and genial, but he is not on the side of consumers and the public interest. Most troubling to consumer advocates was the secrecy around Mr. Pai s early actions. That included a decision to rescind the permissions of nine broadband providers to participate in a federal subsidy plan for consumers. None of the providers currently serve consumers, but Mr. Pai s comments could foreshadow a of the Lifeline subsidy program. On Monday, the F. C. C. is scheduled to appear before a federal judge to defend its push to curb extraordinarily expensive phone call prices from prison. But it told a judge a few days ago that Mr. Pai disagreed with many aspects of the case. Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat of the three sitting members of the F. C. C. warned that the actions would directly harm consumers. Rather than working to close the digital divide, this action widens the gap, Ms. Clyburn said.",FAKE
92,Let s Say Obamacare Is Repealed. What Then? - The New York Times,"The election of Donald J. Trump gives the Republicans in Congress a chance to act on their desire to get rid of Obamacare, a wish that Mr. Trump mostly says he shares. Aaron E. Carroll and Austin Frakt, the health policy analysts for The Upshot, discuss: Then what? Aaron: I think it s safe to say few in Congress thought they would have this opportunity. But like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the car, after untold futile attempts, Republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the Affordable Care Act. Now comes the essential question: Will they actually do it? They ve been promising it forever, but I am still skeptical that it will happen. I believe you disagree. I m going to let you go first. Why do you think they ll do it? Austin: I think they ll do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of repeal, having passed bills to repeal, partly repeal, delay or defund the A. C. A. in the House something like 60 times. Just the other day Senator Mitch McConnell endorsed repeal (again). The House and Senate also agreed to do so, in large part, in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year. The only thing that prevented it was that President Obama vetoed it. I doubt Mr. Trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity. Now, I know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full repeal, because according to the rules it can only touch provisions. This excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime limits, among other measures. I also must add that I m much less confident of a repeal (or partial repeal) without agreement on a replacement. But I ll turn it back to you, Aaron. Do you think the G. O. P. has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to repeal? Or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer benefits? Aaron: I think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier benefits, but not too much. There s a part of me that thinks many in Congress were always so willing to vote for a repeal because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law. They got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside. Actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than 20 million people of their health insurance, without anything in return. This would be an unmitigated political disaster. The stories ” of people with cancer, diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold ” would very likely dominate our discussion for months. That leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the 2018 midterm elections. With no Democratic leaders in any branch of government to blame, I think this would be akin to what happened in the 2010 elections, but in reverse. Now, if they can coalesce around a replace plan that doesn t leave too many people out, then I think they could move forward. But in all the years since the A. C. A. was passed, Republicans haven t been able to do that. Do you think they can? What do you think that plan would look like? Austin: One way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that doesn t call for repeal for several years, at least after the 2018 midterms, though possibly after the 2020 election. Between now and then, there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces Obamacare that didn t just dump people off coverage with no alternative. But the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly. Absolutely there will be bad stories. But keep in mind, there will be bad stories under Obamacare, too. Rocketing premiums, huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success. Republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if they re making Obamacare better. They re actually in a tough policy spot. They ll get the blame if they don t fix or repeal the A. C. A. and they ll get the blame if they don t replace it with something people like better. Health policy is a very difficult and thankless task. I think they ll opt for something they can call repeal and replace, but they could also just let Obamacare struggle and die. Neither looks good. One other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states. Do you think a Trump administration, working with a G. O. P. Congress, will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from Obamacare? If so, what are some ideas states might try? Aaron: I think it s very likely those in Congress could punt Medicaid to the states. For years, they ve been trying to change Medicaid funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time. This will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce Medicaid spending in the future, while forcing states to make the tough decisions ” and take the blame ” for cuts in either beneficiaries or services. Fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges, though, is a different story. Without some sort of market regulation, which they ve generally been opposed to, the same problems that existed . C. A. with respect to conditions and individual ratings will exist. Many people will become uninsured. Annual and lifetime limits could reappear. Lots of people will have problems getting insured. Moreover, I have yet to be convinced that a significant number of Republicans in the House might coalesce around such a plan. Maybe for Medicaid, but I m not sure about the exchanges. Even if they could, it s likely the Democrats in the Senate would try to filibuster either of these plans. Don t you think? Austin: Yes, I think Democrats would filibuster anything they could. The filibuster is not set in stone. A Senate majority can change it, and some are already calling for the G. O. P. to do so. But that doesn t appear to be what the Senate will do ” they ll retain the filibuster. This could play to their favor, since they can propose things they like, let the Democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement. Perhaps that s another way for Republicans to get out of their political bind. Aaron: I m sure we ll have more to discuss as President Trump s administration comes into power.",FAKE
93,Croatia wants to adopt euro within 7-8 years: prime minister,"ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia aims to become a euro zone member within the next seven to eight years, Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said on Monday. We don t want to specify the exact dates, but we want Croatia to become a euro zone member within two government terms in office, Plenkovic told an economic conference devoted to the introduction of the euro in Croatia. The centre-right government came to power a year ago. Plenkovic said Croatia wanted to enter the European exchange rate mechanism II (ERM-2) within the next three years, before the country takes the presidency of the European Union in 2020. EU members that have not yet adopted the euro are expected to participate for at least two years in ERM II, a mechanism aimed to ensure currency stability before joining the euro zone. The Croatian central bank already keeps Croatia s kuna currency in a narrow fluctuation band, roughly at between 7.3 and 7.7 to the euro, occasionally intervening on the local foreign exchange market mostly to ease appreciation pressures. Croatia s major challenge before adopting the euro is expected to be the reduction of public debt which is slightly above 80 percent of gross domestic product. Our goal is to reduce the public debt to 72 percent of GDP by 2020 ... We are undertaking a major fiscal consolidation and this year the budget gap will be even lower than last year s 0.9 percent of GDP, Plenkovic said. Central Bank Governor Boris Vujcic said Croatia was the most euroised EU country of those that had not yet adopted the euro. Some 75 percent of local deposits and 67 percent of local debt is denominated in the euro. Some 60 percent of Croatia s trade exchange is related to the euro zone, while 70 percent of tourism receipts comes from the euro zone countries, Vujcic told the conference. The most important benefits of euro adoption would be the removal of currency risk and lower interest rates, he said. Croatia took an obligation to adopt the euro when it joined the EU in 2013, but without a defined timetable. Vujcic said any fears among the population about prices soaring when the euro is adopted could be tackled by an obligation to display prices in both kunas and euros six months before an agreed euro zone entry date.",FAKE
94,˜Take The Money!! : Emails Show How Clinton Campaign Manages Lobbyist Donations,"The latest batch of emails released by WikiLeaks provides a rare glimpse into how Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton s campaign handles money from U.S. lobbyists who are registered agents for foreign interests.

In an email chain with the subject, Re: Foreign registered agents, various figures in her presidential campaign discuss the best way to handle donations from U.S. lobbyists who are registered agents for foreign parties.

The chain features Dennis Cheng, national finance director for the Clinton campaign, asking, We really need make a policy decision on this soon “ whether we are allowing those lobbying on behalf of foreign governments to raise $ for the campaign. Or case by case. 

The emails continue with a debate about the best way to manage lobbyists working for foreign interests who want to raise money for the campaign.

Jesse Ferguson, deputy national press secretary and senior spokesman for Clinton, tries to understand just how much money is up in the air. Is there anyway to ballpark what percent of our donor base this would apply to (aka how much money we re throwing away) Cost benefits are easier to analyze with the costs. :) 

The emails feature a list of foreign agents that the Clinton campaign was worried about possibly excluding from fundraising, including people lobbying on behalf of Somalia, United Arab Emirates, Kurdistan, the Transitional Government of Libya, and the Republic of Iraq, among others.

Later, Cheng seems worried about losing this potential fundraising, writing, Hi all “ we do need to make a decision on this ASAP as our friends who happen to be registered with FARA are already donating and raising. I do want to push back a bit (it s my job!): I feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table (both for primary and general, and then DNC and state parties) ¦ and how do we explain to people that we ll take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them; that the Foundation takes $ from foreign govts but we now won t. Either way, we need to make a decision soon. 

Finally, Robby Mook, campaign manager for Clinton, writes, Marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions don t really get you anything ¦that Obama actually got judged MORE harshly as a result. He convinced me. So ¦in a complete U-turn, I m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks. Are you guys ok with that? 

Jennifer Palmieri, director of communications for Clinton s campaign, responds to that email, Take the money!!

95,"Terror attack over, 147 dead at Kenya university","NAIROBI, Kenya ” Armed terrorists stormed a university in northern Kenya on Thursday, killing 147 people, wounding dozens and taking hostages during a 15-hour siege until four militants were killed by security forces. Christians and converts to Islam appeared to have been the targets.

More than 550 students were evacuated and 79 were injured in the standoff on the Garissa University campus, about 90 miles from the Somali border. The Somali-based Islamic terrorist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack ” the al-Qaeda-linked organization's deadliest in Kenya.

Students said the gunmen separated Christians from Muslims and held hostages in a dormitory, where they placed explosives around the Christian hostages, according to Kenya's National Police Service.

Kenyan Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery said some students were killed during morning prayers at the mosque. Jackson Kamau, a student at the university, said the militants killed those who were likely converts to Islam. Locals can differentiate between Somali Muslims born into Islam and those who have converted because they come from different ethnic groups.

""We'll not allow terrorists to divide our country on religious lines,"" said Aden Duale, majority leader in Kenya's National Assembly.

Most of the 147 dead were students. Two security guards, one policeman and one soldier also were killed in the attack, Nkaissery said.

One suspected extremist was arrested as he tried to flee, Nkaissery told a news conference in Nairobi.

Heavy gunfire erupted at the college as the Kenyan military worked to end the siege. Police Inspector General Joseph Boinett said a dusk-to-dawn curfew will be in place in Garissa and three neighboring counties starting Friday through April 16.

The White House strongly condemned the attack and said the United States was providing assistance to the Kenyan government.

""We extend our deep condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed in this heinous attack, which reportedly included the targeting of Christian students,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement.

Kenyan police offered a $220,000 bounty for Mohammed Mohamud, also known as Dulyadin and Gamadhere, who they suspect planned the attack.

Students who were able to escape said gunmen stormed the university, setting off explosives and shooting people on the campus just after 5 a.m. local time.

""Most of us were asleep when the incident happened,"" said Nicholas Ntulu, a student at the university. ""We heard heavy gunfire and explosions. Every person ran for dear life as we passed the gunmen. Several (students) were shot dead.

""There was nobody to help us at the time of the attack,"" he said. ""The police officers took more than an hour to arrive at the scene.""

President Uhuru Kenyatta urged Kenyans to stay calm. ""This is a moment for everyone throughout the country to be vigilant as we continue to confront and defeat our enemies,"" he said.

Kenyatta ordered the inspector general of police to accelerate the applications of 10,000 recruits for the Kenya Police College.

""We have suffered unnecessarily due to shortage of security personnel,"" he said. ""Kenya badly needs additional officers, and I will not keep the nation waiting.""

Frightened students rescued from the university gathered at a military camp near the Garissa airstrip.

""The sounds of gunfire was all over ” we couldn't tell what was the right direction to go to be safe,"" said Ann Musyoka, a second-year student. ""We had to face the gunmen ” they shot several people as we escaped towards the gate.""

Victims were rushed to a hospital, and those critically injured were airlifted to the capital, Nairobi.

""I was not at the institution when the incident occurred, but several students phoned me, crying over the attacks,"" said Jacktone Kweya, the dean of students. ""When I tried calling them back, their phones were off. It's very disturbing.""

Robert Godec, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, said the United States ""strongly condemns"" the attack.

""We extend our deepest condolences to all who have been affected,"" he said in a statement. ""The attack once again reinforces the need for all countries and communities to unite in the effort to combat violent extremism.""

The assault comes in the wake of an intelligence report issued last week by security officials warning that al-Shabab was planning an attack on major institutions in retaliation for Kenyan military action in Somalia as part of an African Union initiative against the group.

Al-Shabab has carried out several attacks in Garissa and across Kenya in the past few years, including an attack in 2013 at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi that left 67 people dead, and others on mosques in Mombasa, a coastal city in the east.

Nairobi-based security analyst Abdiwahab Sheikh said the incident highlights how the government has failed to shore up security in the country.

""The government has not learned anything from the Westgate attack,"" he said. ""How do you allow terrorists to take students hostage for more 10 hours? I think our security forces need to learn from the past.""",FAKE
96,"Trump, Clinton meet again at 'humorous' Al Smith dinner","NEW YORK ” Well, that got awkward quickly.

What began as the expected ribbing of presidential candidates at the white-tie Al Smith Dinner Thursday turned to boos as Donald Trump described Hillary Clinton as ""corrupt"" at the event, which is a major fundraiser for the Catholic charities connected to the Archdiocese of New York.

Trump's biggest laugh of the night came as he referred to his wife's partly plagiarized convention speech, in a joke that began with his complaint that the media is biased.

""Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, they think she's absolutely great. My wife, Melania, gives the exact same speech and people get on her case!"" Trump said.

As laughter and applause filled the room Trump speculated he was in ""trouble"" with Melania for the joke, and implored to Cardinal Timothy Dolan: ""Cardinal, please speak to her.""

The crowd stayed with Trump while he ticked down a list of what he called ""corny"" jokes about being a former Democrat and sarcastically calling himself ""modest."" And they mostly laughed along when he joked about Clinton accidentally bumping into him back stage and saying ""pardon me.""

""I very politely replied: Let me talk to you about that after I get into office,"" Trump landed the punchline. Clinton was seen laughing.

But Trump was quick to take some campaign trail attacks with him to the dais at the annual dinner. He called Clinton ""so corrupt she got kicked off the Watergate Commission"" and lobbed his usual line that Clinton has been in politics for 30 years and accomplished little. ""I can fix it, she says,"" he deadpanned as the crowd's mood noticeably shifted.

As the boos rolled in Trump wondered who they were booing. ""I don't know who they're angry at Hillary, you or I?"" he said. Someone in the crowd yelled out ""you!""

Trump's next line struck a nerve. ""Here she is in public, pretending not to hate Catholics,"" Trump said, referencing an apparent email exposed by WikiLeaks in which a Clinton spokeswoman seemed to joke about Catholics and evangelicals.

Trump also brought up a moment from the debate Wednesday night.

""Last night, I called Hillary a 'nasty woman.' This stuff is all relative. After listening to Hillary rattle on and on, I don't think so badly of Rosie O'Donnell anymore. In fact, I'm actually starting like Rosie a lot,"" Trump said.

The Democratic nominee, for her part, poked fun at herself while also taking searing jabs at her opponent. Clinton didn't hesitate to slam Trump for his past comments on women and his ambivalence about accepting next month's election results.

In contrast with Trump, Clinton also made a point of acknowledging both the purpose and the history of the Al Smith dinner and closed her speech with a big-picture campaign message that was tied to the positive focus of Thursday's Catholic fundraiser.

Clinton did receive several loud groans from the audience at several of her jokes. Her top zingers included jabs about Trump dismantling a prompter at a rally last week and her opponent's propensity toward speaking favorably about Russia.

""Maybe you saw Donald dismantle his prompter the other day. And I get that. They're hard to keep up with and I'm sure it's even harder when you're translating from the original Russian,"" she said.

Clinton also joked about her health, which Trump has made an issue on the campaign trail, as well as criticism over paid speeches. ""I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here,"" Clinton told the audience. ""Usually, I charge a lot for speeches like this.""

Turning to Trump, she said, ""Donald, if at any time you don't like what I say, feel free to stand up and shout 'Wrong!' after I say it.""

And diving into the dominant news of the day, she said: ""I'm surprised I'm up here at all. I didn't think he'd be OK with a peaceful transition of power.""

But Clinton had her own sharply-worded jokes. ""People look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants. A beacon of hope for people around the world. Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four ” maybe a five if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair,"" she said.

Clinton joked that ""getting through these three debates with Donald has to count as a miracle.""

""There is nothing like sharing a stage with Donald Trump. Donald wanted me drug tested before last night's debate. And look, I've got to tell you, I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer,"" Clinton said. ""Now, actually I did: it's called preparation.""

Finally, Clinton found a foe that both parties could rally against: ""Let's come together, remember what unites us, and just rip on Ted Cruz.""",FAKE
97,Khizr Khan EVISCERATES Trump For Disrespectful Purple Heart Comments (VIDEO),"Khizr Khan has been nailing Trump ever since he denounced the Republican nominee s hateful rhetoric at Hillary Clinton s Democratic National Convention last week. Things have only escalated as Trump has repeatedly attacked Khan and his wife, who lost their son, Muslim Army Captain Humayan Khan, while he was fighting for our country.But now that Trump has made some truly heartless, disrespectful comments about receiving a Purple Heart from one of his supporters yesterday, Khan came out in full blast and is more furious than ever that Trump disrespected every veteran by saying, I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier. In an interview with CNN s Anderson Cooper, Khan shamed Trump and called the acceptance of the medal heartless. Khan insisted that Trump should have pinned that back to that veteran s chest and should have hugged him and thanked him! Khan, making sure that no one forgets that Trump had the chance to serve his country, and he dodged the draft instead, said: You had your chance. You escaped. You dodged the draft and now you want an easy Purple Heart in your pocket? You should have pinned it back. Even now, call that man. I want his surrogates to call that man, thank him and put that Purple Heart back on that person s chest. He wants to be the leader, commander-in-chief of this United States of America? That is the thoughtfulness? He should have put that Purple Heart back. If he would have been sensible he would have known what it takes to earn that Purple Heart. In fact, Trump had five deferments so that he could avoid serving his country, yet he thinks he is worthy of accepting a veteran s Purple Heart? Really, there is no one more undeserving of a Purple Heart than Trump. You can watch Khan s epic slam of Trump below:Featured image is a screenshot",REAL
98,CLIMATE SCAMMER AL GORE Utterly Embarrassed ¦Can t Explain Why Sea Levels Aren t Rising,"Climate grifter Al Gore is confronted about global warming and sea levels in this classic video where he just can t explain himself. One of the challenges is taking what the scientists say and believing Al GoreOUR LATEST ON AL GORE: NASA S NEW CLIMATE DATA Exposes Al Gore s Lies: The Timing of his New Movie Couldn t be More InconvenientAl Gore has become very wealthy from his invention of global warming and the creation of An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary which has been included in the science curricula of schools throughout the United States. However, the more real climate data we see, the more obvious the hoax becomes.This data couldn t come at a worse time for Al Gore, as his sequel to An Inconvenient Truth, released on July 28, got panned by critics.A.V. Club called An Inconvenient Truth Less a movie than a glorified PowerPoint presentation .A new study from NASA confirms sea levels are falling not rising.iceagenow.info reports: NASA satellite sea level observations for the past 24 years show that on average sea levels have been rising 3.4 millimeters per year. That s 0.134 inches, about the thickness of a dime and a nickel stacked together, per year. As I said, that s the average. But when you focus in on 2016 and 2017, you get a different picture.Sea levels fell in 2016, and with all of this winter s record-breaking snowfall, I wouldn t be surprised if they decline again this year.I clicked and zoomed on the above chart as NASA suggested, and obtained a close-up screen shot of sea levels from Jan 2016 to March 2017. This clearly shows the decline.Al Gore has falsely predicted that sea levels would rise by 20 feet, with some of the world s largest cities underwater.World Tribune reports: Although the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) only predicts a sea level rise of 59cm (17 inches) by 2100, Al Gore in his Oscar-winning film An Inconvenient Truth went much further, talking of 20 feet, and showing computer graphics of cities such as Shanghai and San Francisco half under water, Booker noted. We all know the graphic showing central London in similar plight. As for tiny island nations such as the Maldives and Tuvalu, as Prince Charles likes to tell us and the Archbishop of Canterbury was again parroting last week, they are due to vanish. All of the talk about the sea rising is nothing but a colossal scare story, Booker said, citing Swedish geologist and physicist Nils-Axel Morner, formerly chairman of the INQUA International Commission on Sea Level Change, who for 35 years has been using every known scientific method to study sea levels all over the globe. Despite fluctuations down as well as up, the sea is not rising, Morner says. It hasn t risen in 50 years. If there is any rise this century it will not be more than 10cm (four inches), with an uncertainty of plus or minus 10cm . And quite apart from examining the hard evidence, he says, the elementary laws of physics (latent heat needed to melt ice) tell us that the apocalypse conjured up by Al Gore and Co. could not possibly come about.

99,PM Hariri urges Lebanese to put country first,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri said on Thursday Lebanon s political crisis was a wake-up call for Lebanese with different loyalties to put their country ahead of regional issues. Hariri was referring to the crisis ignited by his shock announcement on Nov. 4 that he was resigning. He made it from Saudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy and regional powerhouse locked in a confrontation with Shi ite Islamist Iran. After returning to Lebanon this week, he shelved the decision on Wednesday at the request of President Michel Aoun. The period that passed was perhaps like a wake-up call for all of us to look for Lebanon s interests rather than looking at problems around us, Hariri said at the Annual Arab Banking Conference in Beirut on Thursday. The problems around us are important, but Lebanon is more important. Hariri reaffirmed the need for Lebanon to stick by its policy of staying out of regional conflict not just with words but with action as well . I want to stress that ... our main concern is stability, and this is what we ll be working on. Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, the head of President Aoun s political party, wrote to the Arab League chief on Thursday, stressing Lebanon s policy of staying out of regional crises, the state news agency reported. The regional role played by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah political and military movement has greatly alarmed Saudi Arabia, Hariri s long-time ally. Hezbollah s parliamentary group met on Thursday and said in a statement afterwards that Hariri s return to Lebanon and his positive statements signaled a possible return to normality. Hariri said on Wednesday his decision to postpone resigning would lead to a responsible dialogue ... that deals with divisive issues and their repercussions on Lebanon s relations with Arab brothers. Top Lebanese officials have said Riyadh forced him to quit and held him in the kingdom. Riyadh and Hariri deny this. Hariri returned to Lebanon after an intervention by France. A leader in Hariri s Future Movement said on Thursday that Hariri s decision to wait instead of officially resigning from his post was a wise step that would allow for more dialogue.",FAKE

102,Facebook Reportedly Complies With Pakistan s Demand to Censor Blasphemy as Call to Hang Blasphemer Trends on Twitter - Breitbart,"The Islamic Republic of Pakistan has launched a crackdown against blasphemy on social media, and Facebook and Twitter are doing little to stop it. According to government sources, Facebook is even assisting Pakistan in removing blasphemous content. [Late last week, government officials in Pakistan informed the Islamabad High Court that almost 85 percent of blasphemous material on Facebook had been taken down at the request of the government. Facebook has yet to publicly confirm or deny this claim from the Pakistani government. However, earlier this month, Facebook ” which claims to be founded on principles of free expression, dispatched a delegation to Pakistan to address the government s demand for religious censorship. At the time of writing, Facebook did not reply to an inquiry from Breitbart News asking the company if they had removed blasphemous material to satisfy Pakistan. Pakistan, a country which once harboured Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden within its borders, recently launched a crackdown on social media blasphemy. The country s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif has ordered authorities to take urgent steps to remove blasphemous content on social media and apprehend those who post it. Last week, three Pakistani bloggers were arrested on suspicion of blasphemy, and had their laptops seized. If convicted, they could face the death penalty. Pakistan wants social media companies to help identify anonymous posters of blapshemous content, and has announced that it will seek the extradition of any Pakistanis who post blasphemous content from abroad. International affairs magazine The Diplomat has branded the crackdown a war on atheism. Meanwhile, on Twitter, a hashtag calling for the execution of one of the arrested blapshemers, ˜#HangAyazNizami, trended in Pakistan as Muslim users took to the platform to call for the blood of heretics. Fuck with freedom of speech hang this fucker asap. ðŸ˜ #HangAyazNizami, ” Sardar Waqar (@Engrr_vicky) March 25, 2017, Call us terrorist or extremist or what everbut he must be hanged #hangayaznizami, ” Daniyal Ahmed (@daniyalaahmed) March 25, 2017, He must be drag in the streets then hanged #HangAyazNizami, ” Nida Ahmed (@nidaa214) March 25, 2017, Western Twitter users reacted strongly against the trend.

Nearly 90,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Aug. 25, following an army crackdown triggered by attacks by Rohingya insurgents in Buddhist-majority Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state. The Rakhine violence has killed at least 400 people, most of them Rohingya insurgents, according to the Myanmar government, leading to the exodus of Rohingya to neighbouring Bangladesh that is struggling to cope with the influx.

104,"John McCain Throws Tantrum, Decries Trump for ˜Letting Assad Stay","21st Century Wire says A predictable reaction from a pair of increasingly desperate politicians.Perennial war hawks Senators John McCain and his partner Lindsey Graham, have expressed their outrage of recent comments by Trump Administration officials that regime change is no longer a priority for the Washington.McCain warned that President Trump s downgrading on policy, away from the overthrow of the Syrian government, was somehow bad for US interests. Such a policy would only exacerbate the terrorist threat to our nation, said McCain.Since at least 2011, McCain has been intimately involved in helping to foment instability in Syria by leading the program to flood illegal arms into Syria for what he and many other America politicians claimed was for the moderate rebels who were fighting for freedom and democracy. It wasn t long before the world finally figured out what the Syrian people knew all along the moderate rebel was a public relation tool, invented by Washington under the Obama Administration.Sadly for McCain, he hasn t been following the news close enough over the last 3 years to realize that the rest of the world has already figured out the West s transparent proxy terrorist marketing campaign.While McCain s public position is predictable still clinging to the fictional narrative laid down by Obama that the Syria public do not support their President and is therefore illegitimate in the eyes of NATO member states, his partner Senator Graham s position is even more erroneous; based on the a long-debunked lie that Assad crossed the red line and used chemical weapons against his own people. McCain with CIA-backed FSA commander Sam Idris and Mouaz Moustafa of the Washington s creation, the Syrian Emergency Task Force (SETF).What makes McCain s rantings even more obscene, is the fact that he has remained completely pro-war in all its forms, and is in total support of proven international terrorists groups like Al Nusra, the Free Syrian Army FSA and Arar al-Sham. In 2011, McCain snuck into Syria illegally to promise militants weapons and support, as well as a US bombing campaign against the Syrian state a war which almost happened under the pretext of a staged false flag chemical attack in East Ghouta outside Damascus in August 2013. BUSY YEAR: 2011 was a busy year for McCain and Graham supporting militants and terrorists. Here they are pictured with Florida Senator Marco Rubio showing off with extremists after the assassination of Gaddafi and before the eventual implosion of the country following the US-led NATO bombing campaign. Supreme Military Council of Syria meeting US Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Mouaz Moustaf (SETF), and CIA agent Evan McMullin (circa 2013-2014)Since 2011, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Hillary Clinton, US Congressman Adam Kinzinger and others, in conjunction with Romney-backed CIA operative turned 2016 Presidential candidate Evan McMullin have led calls to support the various terrorist factions within Syria under the CIA crafted banner of Supreme Military Council of Syria and the The Syrian Revolutionary Front have consistently sold the American public a false narrative via by the Muslim Brotherhood, an extremist political organization supported by Obama administration.4 years later, they are still droning on with the same discredited talking points Daniel Chaitin Washington ExaminerSens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham are upset with the Trump administration signaling that removing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power is no longer a top priority.During a trip to Turkey, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Assad s fate will be decided by the Syrian people. That sentiment was echoed by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who told reporters, You pick and choose your battles. And when we re looking at this it s about changing up priorities and our priority is no longer to sit and focus on getting Assad out. In a statement Thursday evening, McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he is deeply disturbed by Tillerson s and Haley s comments. Their suggestion that Assad can stay in power appears to be just as devoid of strategy as President Obama s pronouncements that Assad must go,' McCain said. Once again, U.S. policy in Syria is being presented piecemeal in press statements without any definition of success, let alone a realistic plan to achieve it. Graham, also a member of the Armed Services committee, said that such comments would be the biggest mistake since President Obama failed to act after drawing a red line against Assad s use of chemical weapons.

105,Trump s Old Campaign Chair Knifed The Man Who Deposed Him In The Back “ And Twisted,"One would think Corey Lewandowski, Trump s former campaign manager, would eventually get tired of swiping at Paul Manafort, the man who replaced him. He s already stabbed Manafort in the back. However, when The New York Times published a report on Manafort s secret ledger in the Ukraine, it seems Lewandowski couldn t resist twisting that knife just a bit.Lewandowski was fired over conflicts with Manafort regarding campaign strategy, and they really didn t part on the best of terms. Earlier this year, Politico reported that these two were at each other s throats to the point where Trump created a new position for Manafort. This was after Manafort tried to bring Lewandowski down.This isn t the first time that he s gunned for Manafort. The last time involved suggesting on CNN that Manafort should be the one who gets fired, or takes the high road and resigns, over the disaster that was Melania Trump s plagiarized speech at the RNC.So the spirit of this tweet is very likely Lewandowski crowing over what may well be Manafort s downfall:Secret Ledger in Ukraine Lists Cash for Donald Trump s Campaign Chief https://t.co/7bh7iIHHaY Corey Lewandowski (@CLewandowski_) August 15, 2016Why downfall? The implications for Manafort are bad, since there s at least $12 million that s slated for him, courtesy of then-President Viktor Yanukovych and his pro-Russian political party. This information also shows how the businesses with which Manafort worked raided Ukraine s assets and influenced what should have been free elections, among other indications of massive corruption.So Manafort s horrifically corrupt, which is probably why Trump wanted him so badly. This info isn t quite new, but these are details that weren t previously known. In other words, it s looking increasingly like Manafort did, indeed, have some kind of hand in helping Russia invade Ukraine, even if it was indirect. Adam Weinstein also tweeted the article, but says his own work shows that this is just the beginning of Manafort s doom: Speaking as someone who has a story coming this week: This is just the beginning for Manafort. It gets worse. https://t.co/5KTUsIHbX1 Adam Weinstein (@AdamWeinstein) August 15, 2016So Lewandowski must be positively gleeful over this. Not that it matters it s not likely Trump would ever bring him back on board. Lewandowski, however, likes to go after his enemies relentlessly, if indirectly.

106,White House Staff Reportedly Went Behind Trump s Back On HUGE Issue Because Trump Is Too Reckless,"Remember when Trump said that we were done with NAFTA, and rumors swirled that he was drafting an executive order withdrawing us from the agreement? And remember how he softened that position very quickly? It seems that he wasn t the one to reach out to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on that, nor did Trudeau call him of his own accord.White House officials reached out to him behind Trump s back.Why? Because they were concerned that Trump would unilaterally yank us out of it, hurting multiple sectors of our economy and doing zero favors for Canada and Mexico as well. So, according to Canada s National Post newspaper, they contacted Trudeau themselves: The unconventional diplomatic manoeuvre approaching the head of a foreign government to influence your own boss proved decisive, as Trump thereafter abandoned his threat to pull out of NAFTA unilaterally, citing the arguments made by Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto as pivotal. Trump, in a childish tantrum, slapped a 20 percent tariff on imports of softwood lumber from Canada, claiming that our agreement with them over that was unfair. He wholly neglected other parts of our trade relationship with Canada, including the fact that they import a lot more dairy from us than they export to us.In other words, if Trump would actually take a look at how things are working, he might find that things aren t quite as unfair to us as he makes them out to be with his tantrums.Trump has also threatened to levy massive taxes on products imported from Rexnord a company that just closed its Indiana plant and laid off more than 300 workers as punishment for sending its jobs to Mexico:Rexnord of Indiana made a deal during the Obama Administration to move to Mexico.

107,Trump says he and China's Xi to try to end opioid crisis,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping would be focusing very strongly on the U.S opioid crisis, which he has declared a public health emergency. Trump said shortly before arriving in Beijing he would discuss as a top priority stopping the flood of cheap and deadly fentanyl manufactured in China when he meets Xi. Every year drug trafficking destroys millions and millions of lives, Trump said in Beijing, standing next to Xi at the end of formal talks between the two. Today President Xi and I discussed ways we can enhance coordination to better counter the deadly drug trade and to stop the lethal flow of poisonous drugs into our countries and into our communities, he added. A special emphasis will be placed on the new phenomenon - fentanyl - destroying lives by the millions. We re going to be focusing on it very strongly, the president and myself, Trump said, without elaborating. Speaking later to reporters, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump and Xi agreed to take new steps. On the critical issue of opioids, we made some good progress to curb the flow of harmful narcotics into the United States in order to save American lives, Tillerson said. The president committed to taking new actions including agreements to control the export and movement of fentanyl precursors, sharing intelligence on drug trafficking, and exchanging trafficking information, he added, referring to Xi. China s drug control agency last week disputed Trump s claim that most of the synthetic drug fentanyl at the heart of the U.S. opioid crisis was produced in China. Opioids include prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic drug 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. The Centers for Disease Control estimated that 20,000 Americans were killed by fentanyl last year, surpassing common painkillers and heroin for the first time. American law enforcement agencies and drug control experts say most of the fentanyl distributed in the United States, as well as precursor chemicals, originate from China. While Chinese officials dispute these claims, Beijing has taken steps to crack down on the production and export of synthetic drugs, and has placed fentanyl and 22 other related compounds on its list of controlled substances.",FAKE

Htin Lynn, Myanmar s ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, told a special session of the Human Rights Council that his government was ready to work with all international partners to ensure the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable repatriation and resettlement of the displaced - whom he did not refer to as Rohingya.

110,Campaigning in style: How Jeb Bush blew through his war chest,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - There were stays at boutique hotels featuring rooftop pools, private soirees at members-only, jacket-and-tie clubs and fundraisers at the Four Seasons, the St. Regis and the Mandarin Oriental. In the world of Jeb Bush, the campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination has at times been a whirl of private planes and high-end affairs, according to the federal filings of Bush s campaign and his Super PAC, Right to Rise, which can raise unlimited funds for Bush as long as it does not coordinate directly with him. It is not unusual for U.S. presidential candidates to fly private or even sometimes stay in luxury hotels. But some disgruntled donors say they are unhappy with Bush s large outlays, which also include big spending on staff and tens of millions of dollars in ad buys. Eleven of 16 major donors contacted by Reuters questioned whether it was money well spent, especially given how the one-time frontrunner has stumbled badly in the polls and is now facing questions about whether he should withdraw from the race. In contrast to Bush, Senator Ted Cruz, who is running second in national polls of Republican voters, favors cheaper accommodation options like Holiday Inn and often flies on budget carriers, campaign finance filings through the third quarter show. Several members of the Bush camp vigorously rejected the donor critiques. Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said, We are running a national campaign that is competing everywhere and we have made investments that have allowed us to do what serious campaigns must do to be competitive in the primary and general elections. Ad-tracking firm SMG Delta says Bush s campaign and Right to Rise have spent $82 million on ads, significantly more than the three leading candidates in the Republican race: Donald Trump ($5 million); Senator Ted Cruz ($11 million) and Senator Marco Rubio ($49 million). The tracking firm s data is more up to date than what has been reported so far in the federal filings. There is no return on investment on the Bush ad buys, zero, said one high-dollar donor who asked not to be named, pointing to how the ads have done little, at least so far, to lift Bush in the polls or dent his opponents. On Sunday, donors will learn just how much Bush has spent from his $100 million-plus war chest. That s when Republican and Democratic candidates and their Super PACs release their latest campaign finance reports. What is known so far is that Bush and Right to Rise spent at least $82 million, both in operating expenditures through the third quarter of 2015 and on ad spending through this month. The campaign finance reports also show that between June 2015, when Bush formally announced his candidacy, and September, the Bush campaign spent $1.2 million on private planes versus the roughly $700,000 spent during the same period by Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Cruz spent $158,000 on private planes, and Rubio $293,300. Trump flies around the country in his own Boeing 757. The former Florida governor s spending pattern illustrates the limits of campaign donations: Even in an era when candidates can receive unlimited sums from wealthy donors, money doesn t guarantee success. They are burning money, said a second major donor, who, like all the other high-dollar donors interviewed, asked not be named for fear of displeasing the Bush family. Look, this is not the election cycle to be spending like a silver-spoon Establishment candidate, said a third donor. It just doesn t look right, the donor said, referring to the way income inequality has emerged as a key theme in the 2016 election. Ambassador Jeanne Phillips, a member of the Right to Rise governance committee, laughed off the criticism. I ve known Jeb for 30 years, so the idea that Jeb would allow anyone around him to be frivolous with money is hilarious, it s ridiculous. The man is the most conservative, fiscally responsible person I ve ever worked with. Bush s campaign committee paid for all lodging on the campaign trail and the vast majority of private air charter, while Right To Rise paid for nearly all the known ad spending. Money donated by both large and small donors kept the Bush camp traveling in style. There were stays at luxury hotels including the Wilshire in Beverly Hills, the Viceroy in Florida, the St. Regis in Dana Point, California, and the W in Stamford, Connecticut, the campaign finance filings show. The filings do not offer a complete picture. It is not clear for example, how many nights were spent at each of the hotels or indeed whether it was Bush himself who stayed or staff members. Bush isn t the only candidate spending at high-end hotels, but it s a high proportion of his overall hotel spending. He spent $125,000,or 70 percent of his total hotel spending between June and September on hotels defined as luxury or upper upscale luxury hotels by STR Global, which tracks supply and demand data in the hotel industry. Cruz and Rubio each spent less on luxury hotels and a smaller proportion of their overall lodging expenses on them, at roughly 56 percent and 61 percent, respectively, federal filings through the third quarter show. Trump flies home nearly every night so he can sleep in his own bed. The Bush campaign and his Super PAC also spent more than $400,000 on renting facilities and catering at posh venues, including the Union League Club and the upscale beachfront 1 Hotel South Beach in Miami, where the Super PAC spent $60,000 last year. Rubio and Cruz spent roughly $265,000 and $185,000 respectively. Bush defenders said the spending on high-end venues was simply how the donor world operated. If you can hold an event at a fancy hotel and raise millions, then it s well worth holding it at a swanky hotel said Charlie Spies, counsel for Right to Rise. Spies said Right to Rise had negotiated below market rates with vendors and consultants, including an overall compensation cap for staff. Nevertheless the Bush camp has spent more on staff and consultants than any of the leading candidates. Starting roughly in the spring, Bush paid out about $8 million. Cruz spent just $2 million; Rubio, just under $2 million; and Trump, $1.7 million. Overall, Trump, Cruz, and Rubio have spent a small fraction of the $82 million Bush has reported paying out. Cruz spent $18.5 million and Rubio outlayed $32 million, according to the filings made so far. Bush is certainly not the only candidate to spend big on the trail. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, for instance, ran an expensive campaign and burned through nearly $10 million before quitting after three months. Bush s prospects were far brighter last summer. Trump had yet to join the race and Bush was making headlines for the size of his war chest. His Super PAC had just cracked its goal of raising more than $100 million in just six months ” an unprecedented haul in American politics. To celebrate, Jeb s parents and family welcomed their large network of well-heeled donors to their oceanside compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, where attendees were treated to rides in private trolley cars, lobster rolls and group photos with the sprawling Bush clan. (This version of the story was refiled to clarify spending in paragraph 25 to show it was by both the campaign and Super PAC)",FAKE
111,"Los Angeles Times Editorial Loses It over Trump: Narcissist, Demagogue - Breitbart","The Los Angeles Times ” which did its best, it admits, to ensure that President Donald Trump would not be elected ” has printed a strident, and nearly hysterical, editorial in which it calls the Trump presidency a train wreck. [Among other things, the Times states: It was no secret during the campaign that Donald Trump was a narcissist and a demagogue who used fear and dishonesty to appeal to the worst in American voters. The Times called him unprepared and unsuited for the job he was seeking, and said his election would be a catastrophe. Still, nothing prepared us for the magnitude of this train wreck. ¦ In a matter of weeks, President Trump has taken dozens of steps that, if they are not reversed, will rip families apart, foul rivers and pollute the air, intensify the calamitous effects of climate change and profoundly weaken the system of American public education for all. ¦ What is most worrisome about Trump is Trump himself. He is a man so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation. His obsession with his own fame, wealth and success, his determination to vanquish enemies real and imagined, his craving for adulation ” these traits were, of course, at the very heart of his outsider campaign indeed, some of them helped get him elected. But in a real presidency in which he wields unimaginable power, they are nothing short of disastrous. The editorial comes just days after Trump s unimaginable power proved unable to force through a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.

112,ZeroCash: A Cryptocurrency s Deep State Ties,"in: Science & Technology October 28, 2016 marks the official launch of Zerocash (Zcash, ZEC ), a new cryptocurrency that has received tremendous attention from the Bitcoin community. The technology is named for its zero-identity function of shielding transactions on its blockchain, or digital ledger. Zerocash is a new protocol that provides a privacy-preserving version of Bitcoin (or a similar currency), its developers explain . [I]n Zerocash, users may pay one another directly, via payment transactions that reveal neither the origin, destination, or amount of the payment. The enthusiasm surrounding the coin is demonstrated in the recent price for Zerocash futures contracts, representing one unit and valued against the price of one Bitcoin (BTC). Between September 15th and October 26th the price surged almost 1,300% ”from a low of $18 (0.027 BTC) to a high of $261 (0.379 BTC). Upon its October 28 debut the price of one Zcash actually exceeded $100,000,000 (one million) on some exchanges , with an average of about around $15,000. The high valuation and scarcity is at least partly influenced by the novel way Zcash is being introduced. The cryptocurrency will not be initially available to investors for over-the-counter purchases and can only be obtained in gradually increasing increments over a month-long period through mining, or digital production by those with the necessary computer equipment and technological expertise. An additional reason for the building excitement around Zcash is that its development team consists of notable computer scientists at University of California at Berkeley, Johns Hopkins University, Tel Aviv University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology state actors, including Amazon, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Office of Naval Research, and the Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology. The entire list of funders is as follows: *Amazon.com *Tel Aviv University Authentication Initiative *Center for Science of Information (CSoI), an NSF Science and Technology Center *Check Point Institute for Information Security *U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) *Air Force Research Laboratory *European Community s Seventh Framework Programme *Israeli Centers of Research Excellence I-CORE program *Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology *The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust *Office of Naval Research *Simons Foundation *Skolkovo Foundation Libertarians especially, with their philosophical antipathy toward state monopoly that central banking epitomizes have been among the most vigorous supporters of cryptocurrency development and use. This is accentuated by the fact that traditional markets for hard money investment such as precious metals are likewise subject to heavy manipulation by the same or allied central banking outlets. Yet one would be hard-pressed to come up with a greater illustration of centralized state power than the array of interests listed above. Indeed, the involvement of such actors in developing the next Bitcoin should be recognized vis-a-vis the Western financial community s continued advocacy for the drastic reduction of conventional central bank-issued currency from circulation (i.e. here , here , here , here and here ). In theory Zerocash differs from Bitcion in that it represents a bolstered technology for anonymous transactions veiled from third party scrutiny. According to the mechanics such transactions may be viewed and recorded by the specific parties who obtains proper authorization. What if a Trojan Horse capability could be engineered into the currency that might later be utilized by lettered agencies? This is the greatest fear of those who rightly question the loss of tangible exchange. Further, such a development would defeat ZeroCash s desirability and purpose. By dismissing the possibility of such a feature Zcash users implicitly rely on the integrity of the developers themselves, most of whom are junior faculty or graduate students whose research, as noted, is at least partly funded by such deep state actors. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts regard cryptocurrencies as a sort of deus ex machina against the state. Along these lines, Zerocash s institutional and scholarly veneer cloaks the more complex grant-generating interests lurking in the shadows. Recently even strong advocates of Bitcoin have pondered if the financial medium may have been developed with direct or indirect participation of the intelligence community. In the case of Zcash there can be no doubt of such deep state interest and involvement, which is of no small concern as the world moves toward a seemingly inevitable cashless society.

113,Jury selection begins in Colorado theater shooting trial,"CENTENNIAL, Colo. ” Gone are the orange hair and the thousand-yard stare. In their place, trimmed hair, a shaggy beard and red-framed glasses.

Sitting upright in court in a dark jacket, blue striped shirt and khaki slacks, James Holmes looking very much like the neuroscience graduate student he used to be, not a man on trial for his life.

But Holmes, now 27, faces 12 murder charges in connection with the summer 2012 massacre at a suburban Denver movie theater's midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises. He could be executed if convicted. Holmes also faces dozens of other charges, including attempted murder. At least 70 were wounded in the massacre.

Jury selection in the case began Tuesday afternoon, and Judge Carlos Samour said an initial pool of 9,000 jurors will be whittled down to 12, plus 12 alternates. The trial may last into October.

Once opening statements get underway, cameras will be allowed in the courtroom. However, they are not allowed during jury selection.

In a lengthy address to prosecutors and Holmes' defense team, Samour said he expects ""passionate and zealous"" courtroom arguments, but reminded both sides and prospective jurors that Holmes is innocent until proven guilty. The jury that will decide Holmes' guilt also will decide whether he should be executed.

""What's most important to me is that justice is done,"" said Samour. ""That's what this whole process is about: Justice.""

Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler wants Holmes put to death for the July 20, 2012, mass shooting in Aurora. He argues that life in prison is insufficient justice for the victims, survivors and their families.

By pleading not guilty by reason of insanity, Holmes admitted he committed the shooting but claims he's legally not responsible for his actions. He's undergone at least two mental-health evaluations at the state mental hospital, but the results have remained secret.

Holmes, then 24, was arrested at the scene by investigators who then discovered his apartment had been booby-trapped with explosives. His lawyers acknowledge Holmes, a former neuroscience doctorate student, was the lone shooter but say he was gripped by a psychotic episode.

Legal analyst Scott Robinson said insanity-plea cases are rare, and it's even more unusual for a jury to find someone not guilty by reason of insanity.

""It's a minuscule percentage ... yet the public perception is that people are getting off on the insanity plea all the time,"" said Robinson. ""It's actually a rare bird.""

In December 2014 ” just as jury summons went out ” Holmes' parents issued a public statement begging prosecutors to drop the death penalty and give their son a plea deal that would see him locked up and treated.

""We do not know how many victims of the theater shooting would like to see our son killed. But we are aware of people's sentiments,"" they wrote. ""We have read postings on the Internet that have likened him to a monster. He is not a monster. He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness.""",FAKE
114,Iraq says Iran has shut border with Kurdistan,"BAGHDAD/DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Sunday shut its border crossings with Iraq s Kurdistan in support of measures taken by the Iraqi government to isolate the Kurdish region, the Iraqi foreign ministry said. At the request of the Iraqi government, the Islamic Republic of Iran closed today the border crossings with the Kurdistan region of Iraq, the Iraqi foreign ministry said in a statement in Baghdad. Earlier in the day, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi had indirectly dismissed claims these crossings were shut. As far as I know, nothing new has happened in this area, the Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) quoted him as saying. An Iranian MP Mohammad-Javad Nobandegani said Tehran did not want to publicize the closing of the border. There is no need for explicit publicity, the MP was quoted as saying by Iran s ILNA news agency. The closure would negatively impact residents who depend on border trade, he said, adding that national interests sometimes require us to act this way. Iran last month halted flights to and from Kurdish regions in northern Iraq over the independence referendum by the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Tehran also carried out war games at the Kurdish border in September. Tehran fears the spread of separatism to its own Kurdish population, which is around 8 million. Iran backs Shi ite groups which have been ruling or holding key security and government positions in Iraq since the 2003 U.S-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein.",FAKE

The Democratic Party defended slavery, started the Civil War, opposed reconstruction, founded the Ku Klux Klan, imposed segregation, perpetrated lynching and fought against the Civil Rights Acts of the 1950 s and 1960 s. In contrast, the Republican Party was founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery party. Its mission was to stop the spread of slavery into the new western territory with the aim of abolishing it entirely.

For example, he once tweeted that, Obama is, without question, the WORST EVER president.

On Arianna Huffington he tweeted, @ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision. At 3:00 a.m. in late September, Donald unleashed a seemingly drunken barrage of tweets to tell his 13 million followers to check out former Miss Universe Alicia Macado s sex tape which totally does not exist.And those are his nice tweets. With people going to the polls on Tuesday, Trump s aides have revoked access to his Twitter account, according to a new report.Aides to Mr. Trump have finally wrested away the Twitter account that he used to colorfully and often counterproductively savage his rivals. But offline, Mr. Trump still privately muses about all of the ways he will punish his enemies after Election Day, including a threat to fund a super PAC with vengeance as its core mission.We re not sure why they didn t do this sooner.Several advisers warned him that he risked becoming like a wild animal chasing its prey so zealously that it raced over a cliff a reminder that he could pursue his grievances and his eagerness to fling insults, but that the cost would be a plunge into an electoral abyss.Taking away Twitter turned out to be an essential move by his press team, which deprived him of a previously unfiltered channel for his aggressions.On Thursday, the GOP presidential nominee spotted Air Force One outside his airplane window while it was on the tarmac in Miami.As he glowered at the larger plane, he told Ms. Hicks, his spokeswoman, to jot down a proposed tweet about President Obama, who was campaigning nearby for Mrs. Clinton. Why is he campaigning instead of creating jobs and fixing Obamacare? Trump said of his proposed tweet. Get back to work. Hope Hicks felt the need to edit it, adding for the American people at the end.Steve Bannon who was recruited into Trump s campaign from Breitbart.com suggested that it was a trap. They want to get inside your head, Bannon told him. It s a trap. Or, just maybe, Air Force One was there for other reasons and not following Trump around. Even on 9/11, Trump threw insults out on the day most of us remember the victims of the worst terrorist attack on American soil.On the eleventh hour, just says before American voters will decide who should become the next leader of the free world, Trump s aides finally took Donald s Twitter account away from him.Photo by Chip Somodevilla via Getty.",REAL
117,TEACHER S UNION PROTEST Gets Ugly As Protesters And Cops Duke It Out [Video],"In case you don t live in the Midwest, you might not have noticed that the fight continues between the Democrat-lead powers that just won t let go after decades of disaster in the city of Detroit. It s like the abused wife who s more comfortable with the evil she knows rather than getting the heck out of Dodge to find a better situation. The people of Detroit are still fighting the perceived racism from anywhere and everywhere in Republican Governor Snyyder s administration. The Democrats that ran the city into the ground with so much corruption and so many inept officials want the same-old same old back and want Emergency Managers put in place by Snyder to go away. The latest problem is with the Detroit Public Schools and the water scandal in the city of Flint. Here s the take from the Detroit News:Detroit Hundreds of teachers, activists and students gathered Wednesday outside Cobo Center in a combined effort to protest conditions in Flint and at Detroit Public School buildings.The protest outside Cobo came hours before President Barack Obama s scheduled visit to the North American International Auto Show inside the building. Snyder out, is a must, the crowd chanted, led by leaders wielding megaphones. Detroit won t go to the back of the bus. Joel Berger, an English teacher at Cass Technical High School, said the city-wide sickout and protest stemmed from a grassroots effort by teachers, students and parents.He also joined many protesters in directly linking issues in DPS and Flint. Teachers, parents and students are just fed up with the injustices that are being done to our students, Berger said. It s about (Darnell) Earley, who was the emergency manager in Flint when they switched their water over, and now he s being charged with looking over Detroit Public Schools. We re building toward a city-wide strike to restore the rights of the people of Detroit now, and to get rid of the (DPS) emergency manager, he said. It s clear that the state takeovers and the elimination of democratic control across Michigan cities has only created more destruction in black, Latino and poor communities, he said. In Flint, we had emergency manager Darnell Earley, who said himself that to save money, they d switch water from the Detroit water system to the Flint River. This is a city-wide struggle about our future, Douglass said. It s going to take this movement to prevent the racist attacks. Supporters of ousted teachers union president Steve Conn clash with Detroit police officers and hotel security at the Hilton Garden Hotel in Detroit where a hearing was held on Conn s bid to be reinstated.Some protesters insisted the sickout symbolized support for Steve Conn, the ousted former president of the Detroit Federation of Teachers union.The DFT executive board removed Conn from office and expelled him from the union in August after finding him guilty of internal misconduct charges.Read more: Detroit News",REAL
118,U.S. EPA employees protest Trump's pick to run agency,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former and current employees of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency expressed opposition to President Donald Trump s pick to run the agency on Monday - in an open letter and a small street protest - reflecting divisions over the new administration s plans to slash regulation. Over 400 former EPA staff members sent a letter to the U.S. Senate asking it to reject the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as the agency s new leader, saying he has shown no interest in enforcing environmental laws. In Chicago, around 30 employees of the EPA s regional office there joined a protest organized by the Sierra Club environmental group and the American Federation of Government Employees to protest Pruitt s nomination. Doug Eriksen, a spokesman for Trump s transition team at the EPA, downplayed the Chicago protest, saying employees have a right to take action on their private time. Trump has vowed to cut regulation to revive the oil, gas and coal industries, and has said he can do so without compromising air and water quality. He nominated Pruitt, who has sued the EPA more than a dozen times as Oklahoma s top prosecutor to block its regulations, to run the agency, sparking alarm among Democrats and environmentalists. Last Thursday, the Senate environment committee approved Pruitt despite a boycott of his nomination by the panel s Democratic members. He is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate, in Republican control after last November s election, but a date for the vote has not been set. The former EPA employees who sent the letter to the Senate wrote that they believed Pruitt has a history of siding with industry and has been reluctant to accept the strong scientific consensus on climate change. Employees at the Chicago rally raised concerns that Pruitt may cut employees and resources needed for the agency to enforce environmental regulations. The EPA needs to be able to enforce the rules when companies are breaking the law, said Sherry Estes, an EPA lawyer who participated in the protest.",FAKE
119,#BlackLivesMatter: Why movement is its own worst enemy,"Editor's note: The following column appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.

#BlackLivesMatter is fast becoming its own worst enemy.

It lacks an agenda, it is antagonizing the black community s top white political allies, including Democrats running for the party s 2016 presidential nomination, and it is not finding common ground with any of the Republican majority in Congress.

The catalyst for the movement was outrage over the deaths of young black men like Freddie Gray, Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police officers who arguably used excessive, even deadly force. But where is the list of solutions to the injustices it so often decries?

The movement s failure to get its collective act together carries real danger for the political clout of the African-American community in the 2016 elections and beyond.

With the movement potentially discouraging black American trust in Democrats, #BlackLivesMatter is increasing the odds of a sharp drop in black voter turnout in 2016. Already Democrats privately worry that without President Obama on the ballot, the black vote will decrease the turnout needed to keep the White House and win back the Senate.

That is more likely to happen if black voters get caught up in the anger that the BlackLives movement has directed at the political structure. The potential absence of black voters who have become discouraged ” about a quarter of the nation s Democrats ” would be more devastating than any Republican plan to require voter identification, reduce the number of polling places in black neighborhoods or cut back on early voting.

When BlackLives activists denounce the Democratic National Committee for issuing a resolution in support of police reform, they are hurting themselves with party officials. When they say that all political parties try to control or contain black liberation, they are also damaging faith in the political system, especially among young people.

When they interrupt Democrats running for the presidential nomination, such as Bernie Sanders and Martin O Malley, they are alienating longtime political allies and their supporters. When they videotape Hillary Clinton after she generously agrees to meet with them privately ” in an apparent attempt to embarrass her ” they are distancing themselves from the likely Democratic nominee. And imagine how local and state officials will react now to any request for a meeting with the group.

Meanwhile, they are not finding common cause with Latinos, even as immigrants are being attacked by the Republican candidates for the presidential election. Have you seen BlackLives interrupting Donald Trump s events? Where is the outreach to Republicans?

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is one the most outspoken leaders in either political party on the racial inequities of prison reform. I see an America where criminal justice is applied equally and any law that disproportionately incarcerates people of color is repealed, he said in his announcement speech. If change is the goal, where is the alliance with the senator?

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor, has declared on the campaign trail that the war on drugs has been a failure. He told an audience last month everyone makes mistakes and that society needs to reach out and embrace those people and say, ˜If you re not a violent offender, if you re not dealing drugs to our children, we need to get you treatment rather than prison. 

Earlier this year, the Brennan Center for Law and Justice published a collection of essays highlighting the bipartisan consensus among national politicians that there is a need for sentencing reform, called Solutions: American Leaders speak out on Criminal Justice. Clinton, O Malley, Paul, Christie and fellow presidential candidates Jim Webb, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Scott Walker and Marco Rubio each penned essays for the Brennan Center on the need for reform.

And it s not just those running for the Oval Office ” leading congressional Republicans like Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Tea Party favorite Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) have all endorsed proposals to relax the federal sentencing laws. Grassley has said he wants to move on a bill this year to do just that.

A bipartisan bill, the Safe, Accountable, Fair, and Effective (SAFE) Justice Act authored by Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, has about three-dozen bipartisan co-sponsors in the House already. If #BlackLivesMatter protesters were chanting Pass the SAFE Justice Act now! they could find themselves in position to make significant change. Somehow they are blind to the opportunity.

It has been said that politicians see the light once they feel the heat. If only the energy and passion of #BlackLivesMatter protesters could be harnessed in something constructive rather than destructive.

Lobby Congress, hold voter registration drives, quiz candidates on their plan for sentencing reform, but don t heckle the candidates and incite violence by calling for cop-killing. The movement could be critical to securing and mobilizing black support for criminal justice reform that actually would improve black lives.

I am reminded of something my father, who trained boxers, once told me.

He said even the best fighters know fear is like fire. It can cook your food and light your home. It can also burn your house down and kill you. The key to controlling fear or fire is turning it to a constructive purpose.

Now if only #BlackLivesMatter will harness its own fire into the urgent cause of criminal justice reform.

120,IF YOU CROSS OUR BORDERS ILLEGALLY ¦.YOU CAN NOW LAND A JOB TEACHING IN THIS STATE,"We re going to have people who are bilingual teachers, and ultimately people who just want to do the right thing for the United States. So in other words, soon it won t matter if these illegal alien teachers are able to speak english as long as they want to do the right thing? Gov. Brian Sandoval signed a bill Wednesday that would make it easier for immigrants with temporary legal status to get a Nevada teaching license, saying it would help meet the needs of a new Nevada. Among the people who flanked the Republican governor as he signed AB27 was Uriel Garcia, a 22-year-old Nevada State College student and recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program who was previously denied a license. He said he plans to re-apply as soon as possible to get started on his student teaching and move toward his goal of teaching 2nd grade English language learners. I want to give back to the community that gave me so much, Garcia said.The old law allowed the state superintendent to give a teaching license to someone who is not a citizen but has a work permit only if there s a teacher shortage for a subject the person can teach. The new law, which passed the Senate and Assembly unanimously, allows those immigrants to get a teaching license if a district has a teacher shortage of any kind.The measure affects immigrants in the deferred action program, also known as DACA recipients or DREAMers. State Superintendent Dale Erquiaga said it s not clear how many new teachers the change will yield, but said his office will track that number going forward.Proponents framed the bill as a way to deal with a major teacher shortage, as well as a way to diversify the teaching force in a state with a high population of English language learners. We re going to have people who are bilingual teachers, and ultimately people who just want to do the right thing for the United States, Garcia said.Sylvia Lazos, vice chair of the Latino Leadership Council, said the bill better reflects a changing Nevada. These laws that prohibit non-citizens from getting licensed come from another era, another time, when many states were hostile to Germans, Catholics, Irish, Lazos said. Modern Nevada is not protectionist, not anti-immigrant, not anti-foreigner. It s a wonderful day for Nevada to affirm that. Via: Chron",REAL
121,U.S. House approves tighter North Korea sanctions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved legislation on Thursday to tighten sanctions on North Korea by targeting its shipping industry and companies that do business with the reclusive state. The vote was 419 to 1. Supporters said the legislation was intended to send a strong message to North Korea, amid international concern over the escalation of its nuclear program. The measure would have to be approved by the Senate before it could be sent to the White House for President Donald Trump to sign into law. Although legislation addressing North Korea has been introduced in the Senate, there was no immediate word on when or if the Senate might take up a bill. Any new U.S. sanctions against North Korea would likely affect China, the North s most important trade partner. While China has been angered by North Korea s nuclear and missile tests, it has signed up for increasingly tough U.N. sanctions against it, and says it is committed to enforcing them. Asked about the latest U.S. legislation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated that China opposed other countries using their own domestic law to impose unilateral sanctions. With the situation tense on the Korean Peninsula, all sides need to exercise restraint and not irritate each other to avoid the situation worsening, he said.",FAKE
122,"Craig Sager, Colorful N.B.A. Sideline Reporter, Dies at 65 - The New York Times","Craig Sager, an exuberant sideline reporter for National Basketball Association television broadcasts who was as well known for his outlandishly garish outfits as for the questions he asked coaches and players, died on Thursday in Atlanta. He was 65. The cause was leukemia, according to a spokesman for Turner Sports. After receiving the diagnosis in 2014, Mr. Sager continued to work occasionally during what became a highly public illness. He received blood transfusions to be strong enough to travel to some games, and returned to a hospital after others. He last appeared in a game broadcast in June and canceled plans to work for NBC at the Summer Olympics in Brazil in August to continue treatment. Mr. Sager brought deep knowledge of basketball and a spirit to his work. He was known for working behind the scenes to find news that he could use in his reports or give to announcing colleagues like Marv Albert and Reggie Miller. He was always hovering around the benches, Mr. Albert said in a recent telephone interview. And players told him things. But his journalism competed for attention with his psychedelic wardrobe. He strode the sideline of N. B. A. arenas in lilac, orange, banana yellow, black and lime green outfits ” some in medleys of colors arrayed in stripes, plaids, swirls and other patterns that resembled Rorschach tests. He abhorred repeating any combinations. My clothes reflect who I am, he wrote in Living Out Loud: Sports, Cancer and the Things Worth Fighting For, his autobiography, which was published in November. I believe that life should be fun and so should your clothes. His ensembles set him apart from other sideline reporters, who are usually bit players on sports broadcasts, typically given no more than one or two minutes to question sweaty athletes and cranky coaches between quarters, at halftime or after games. But Mr. Sager, with questions as well planned as his ensembles, became a favorite of players and coaches, not to mention the fans in the seats, as he walked into an arena in his sartorial splendor. He had a very good relationship with players, but that didn t mean he wouldn t ask tough questions, Mr. Albert said. I also thought that the outfits he wore made him underrated. As his illness progressed, Mr. Sager had three bone marrow transplants, two from his older son, Craig II. On Mr. Sager s return from a long hospital stay, his condition prompted Gregg Popovich, the San Antonio Spurs coach who is notoriously terse when responding to sideline reporters, to show rare warmth to Mr. Sager. This is the first time I ve enjoyed doing this ridiculous interview we re required to do, Mr. Popovich said, and that s because you re here and you re back with us. Then he added, Now ask me a couple of inane questions. In June, Mr. Sager, who worked for TNT, was asked to be a sideline reporter at Game 6 of the N. B. A. finals on ABC, a rare invitation from a rival network. He scheduled the assignment ” his first during a finals ” between an course of chemotherapy at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and a Father s Day outing in Florida. Not surprisingly, he purchased a new outfit for the game. I can t bring out something I ve already worn, he said in an interview with The New York Times. I want to make sure I don t look down. I want people to say, ˜Man, he looks good. After the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Golden State Warriors in Game 6, Mr. Sager interviewed the Cavaliers star LeBron James. After answering several questions, Mr. James reversed roles with Mr. Sager and asked: How in the hell did you go years without getting a finals game? That don t make no sense. Mr. Sager smiled and said, Thanks a lot for entertaining me. Craig Graham Sager was born on June 29, 1951, in Batavia, Ill. His father, Al, was an advertising and executive his mother, Coral, was an avid golfer who held a pilot s license. Mr. Sager attended Northwestern University, where, after trying out for the football team and playing for the freshman basketball team, he stepped into one of his earliest outrageous guises: Willie the Wildcat, the university s mascot. After Northwestern s football team upset Ohio State, Mr. Sager taunted the losing players while still in costume. In response, he wrote, members of the Ohio State marching band began to push me and poke me with their flagpoles. After graduation he became a reporter for a radio station in Sarasota, Fla. On one assignment he leapt onto the field at County Stadium after Hank Aaron hit his 715th home run to surpass Babe Ruth as baseball s home run king. Wearing a trench coat, Mr. Sager, then 23, caught up to Mr. Aaron at home plate, amid a scrum of fans, reporters and relatives, to briefly interview him. Three years later, while covering the Belmont Stakes, Mr. Sager slept in Seattle Slew s stable the night before the thoroughbred won the Triple Crown. Before leaving to take the horse for a morning walk, Mr. Sager wrote, he scooped up a piece of Seattle Slew s excrement and preserved it for the next 39 years as a fragment of history. Mr. Sager also worked at TV stations in Florida and Kansas City, Mo. before joining CNN in 1981. In 1990 he moved to Turner Sports, where, besides the N. B. A. he covered golf, the National Football League, college football and basketball, and Major League Baseball. Mr. Sager is survived by his son Craig as well as another son, Ryan his daughters, Kacy, Krista and Riley Sager his second wife, Stacy and a sister, Candy Menzemer. Mr. Sager s positive attitude and consuming desire to return to the sideline won him the Jimmy V Perseverance Award ” named for Jim Valvano, the former North Carolina State basketball coach and ESPN commentator who died of bone cancer in 1993 ” at the ESPY Awards show in July. Wearing a floral print jacket, he said in his acceptance speech: Whatever I might have imagined a terminal diagnosis would do to my spirit, it summoned quite the opposite ” the greatest appreciation for life itself. So I will never give up, and I will never give in.",FAKE
123,Trump Labor Dept wants salary to count in overtime eligibility,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Labor Department on Friday defended its authority to use salary levels to decide who was eligible for overtime pay but distanced itself from an Obama administration rule that greatly expanded the number of qualifying workers. Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the Labor Department has continued to fight a challenge to an Obama administration-era rule to raise the pay threshold for overtime eligibility. But it has not endorsed the former administration s move to nearly double that threshold, an increase strongly opposed by business groups. The Labor Department told a federal appeals court on Friday it had the power to use salaries to set thresholds for mandatory overtime pay, without advocating for the $47,500 maximum salary level set by the department under Obama. The Labor Department is challenging a November decision from a federal judge in Texas that blocked the Obama rule, a decision that the department said could prevent it from setting a new threshold below that set by the Obama administration. The Obama rule was expected to extend overtime pay eligibility to more than 4 million salaried workers. Nevada and 20 other states sued last year to block the rule. Business groups criticized the increase as too drastic and costly, potentially forcing employers to convert salaried workers to hourly wages. Trump s Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta said during his confirmation hearing in March that the correct threshold might be around $33,000. The Labor Department took initial steps earlier this week to begin developing a new threshold. In its Friday brief to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals, the Labor Department made it clear it did not support the salary threshold developed under Obama. But the department told the court it was reluctant to move forward with the rulemaking necessary to set a new threshold as long as its authority was in question. Nevada and the other states have said that the use of a salary threshold to determine overtime eligibility has been controversial for decades, but appeals courts allowed it because it had been set low enough to exempt management workers. But the Obama administration rule is far more drastic, the states said, expanding overtime pay to tens of thousands of state employees. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, criticized the Labor Department s handling of the appeal, saying in a statement that the administration appears to be preparing to roll back overtime protections for millions of workers.",FAKE
124,Buffett hits back at Trump over tax comments,"(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett denied on Monday an allegation by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that he, like Trump, had taken a massive deduction that allowed him to avoid federal income taxes. Buffett said he paid about $1.85 million in income tax in 2015, and that returns for previous years were similar in respect to contributions, deductions and tax rates. Buffett said he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, but had no problem releasing his tax information. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, citing ongoing audits by the IRS. I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13, Buffett said in a statement, adding that being a slow starter, I owed only $7 in tax that year. Buffett, ranked the world s third-richest person by Forbes magazine, said he had copies of all 72 of his returns and none uses a carryforward. Responding to an Oct. 1 New York Times story, Trump acknowledged during the presidential-candidates debate on Sunday that he had used investment losses to avoid paying taxes. Trump repeatedly said he was only taking advantage of tax provisions used by wealthy people who support Clinton. I absolutely used it, and so did Warren Buffett ... , he said. The Times reported that Trump s declared loss of $916 million in 1995 was so large that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), said his 2015 tax return showed adjusted gross income of $11,563,931. My deductions totaled $5,477,694, of which allowable charitable contributions were $3,469,179. All but $36,037 of the remainder was for state income taxes, he said. The total charitable contributions I made during the year were $2,858,057,970, of which more than $2.85 billion were not taken as deductions and never will be. Tax law properly limits charitable deductions, Buffett said. Buffett said he had no problem releasing his tax information while under audit. Neither would Mr Trump “ at least he would have no legal problem.",FAKE

126,Cuba urges U.S. not to politicize allegations of harmed diplomats,"UNITED NATIONS/HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba urged the United States on Friday to cooperate with its investigation into incidents that the U.S. says have harmed its diplomats in Havana and not to politicize the matter, days after Washington said it was considering closing its Cuban embassy. In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said the top level of the government in Havana had ordered an investigation into the mysterious matter, which threatens the fragile detente between the old Cold War foes. However, a Cuban government source told Reuters that the United States had provided no evidence of the harm, including hearing loss, dizziness and nausea, that it says U.S. diplomats and their relatives based in Havana have suffered. Cuban doctors had also not been allowed to examine anyone, the source said. A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Havana declined to comment. The investigation to clarify this issue continues, and in order to be able to arrive to a conclusion, it will be crucial to count on the cooperation of the U.S. authorities, Rodriguez told the U.N. It would be unfortunate if a matter of this nature is politicized, said Rodriguez. Cuba has denied any involvement in the affair. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was among five Republican senators that a week ago called for U.S. President Donald Trump to retaliate against Cuba by expelling its diplomats and possibly shuttering the U.S. embassy in Havana. Rubio helped forge Trump s new Cuba policy, rolling back parts of the detente achieved under Democratic former President Barack Obama and taking a harder line on the Communist-run island. Cuba s state-run media this week said the only party interested in a deterioration in relations were a small group of Republicans led by Rubio. The U.S. government in August first officially confirmed they were investigating the incidents it said began in late 2016. Several Canadians were also affected, a Canadian official said, further deepening the mystery. The last incident to affect a U.S. citizen occurred late in August, bringing the number of those with symptoms to 21, a U.S. State Department official said last week. Some of those had returned home for testing and treatment, the U.S. official said, while others had been tested in Cuba, where the embassy has a fulltime medical officer. Investigations by Cuba, the United States and Canada have yet to come up with any answers. Experts agree it is hard to see how any attacks could have been carried out or what the motivation could be. Theories abound, from surveillance technology gone awry to a sophisticated acoustic weapon in the hands of Cuban-American exiles or third-party state actors such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, but most flounder. Audiologists for example have raised doubt over the possibility of whether any sonic weapon exists that can be used covertly to bring about the range of symptoms mentioned by diplomats.",FAKE
127,Federal Judge Blocks Indiana Abortion Law - The New York Times,"A federal judge on Thursday blocked an Indiana law that would have banned abortions based solely on a fetus s disability or genetic anomaly, suggesting that it was an illegal limit on a woman s constitutional right. Judge Tanya Walton Pratt, of Federal District Court for Southern Indiana, also held up a state ban on abortions motivated solely by a fetus s race or sex. In the preliminary injunction, Judge Pratt said limiting the reasons for an abortion was inconsistent with the notion of a right rooted in privacy concerns and a liberty right to make independent decisions. While Judge Pratt s injunction stops the law from taking immediate effect, and though she said the state would be unlikely to prevail at trial, the state can still defend the legislation. In a statement, the Indiana attorney general s office said state lawyers would consider how to proceed and whether to appeal the injunction. Indiana would have been the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome. A handful of states have bans on abortion based on sex, one state has a ban based on race, and two have bans based on genetic anomalies, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit abortion rights group that tracks state laws. Judge Pratt s decision, the first in a federal court to indicate that a ban on abortion because of genetic anomalies would likely be unconstitutional, is the latest setback for groups. It comes days after a landmark Supreme Court ruling in a Texas case that two other kinds of restrictions ” requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and imposing stringent standards on abortion clinics ” are unconstitutional. The Texas measures would have forced many clinics to shut down. In language that is expected to echo nationally, the Supreme Court held in its Monday ruling that the benefits of any such restrictions must be closely scrutinized and weighed against the burdens on women s access to abortion. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement that momentum from Monday s landmark decision was aiding in challenges to abortion restrictions in Indiana and elsewhere. These unconstitutional laws punish women, and we will bring them down, law by law and state by state, Ms. Richards said. We have been fighting these restrictions on all fronts for years, organizing in the field, building for this moment ” and now the wind is at our backs. Kara Brooks, a spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Pence, said in a statement on Thursday that the governor was disappointed in the ruling and remains steadfast in his support for the unborn, especially those with disabilities. Judge Pratt s decision was also criticized in a statement by Indiana Right to Life, which noted that the jurist had been nominated by President Obama. That group s chief executive, Mike Fichter, said the ruling denied the civil rights of unborn children and was an appalling human rights injustice. Thursday s case in Indiana was argued long before the new Supreme Court decision, and Judge Pratt s opinion made no reference to it. Her ruling rested largely on the argument that the state, as established in a series of cases starting with Roe v. Wade in 1973, cannot impede a woman s right to decide to have an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, usually at around 24 weeks. Judge Pratt said irreparable harm would have occurred had that part of the law taken effect as scheduled on Friday. Difficult moral and complicated health decisions are made by women whose pregnancies are affected by a prenatal fetal anomaly, Judge Pratt wrote in her ruling. Given the relatively short time frame in which women may elect to terminate a pregnancy, even a short disruption of a woman s ability to do so could have significant consequences. Indiana s law, signed in March by Mr. Pence, was framed by abortion foes and legislative Republicans as a way to prevent discrimination in abortions, in particular the fetuses with Down syndrome. Mr. Pence, a Republican, said that he signed the law with a prayer that God would continue to bless these precious children, mothers and families. But the local chapters of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the measure, claiming the law posed an undue burden to women and restricted freedom of speech, and asking Judge Pratt for the preliminary injunction she issued on Thursday. That injunction also sets aside a portion of the law that imposed new restrictions for disposing of fetal remains. Indiana s law was exceptional for its breadth, but the restrictions it included were not unprecedented. Such legislation has become more common and has gained traction in many statehouses. Dawn Johnsen, an Indiana University law professor who has pushed for abortion rights, said Thursday s injunction was an important step toward invalidating such legislation. It s very strong reaffirmation of the constitutional right as the Supreme Court has interpreted it, but applied to new, creative, harmful restrictions, Ms. Johnsen said. The Indiana measure had been controversial from the start, and Mr. Pence waited until his deadline before signing it into law. In the weeks that followed, abortion rights supporters rallied outside the Capitol against the law and started an online Periods for Pence campaign that encouraged women to tell the governor about their reproductive health.",FAKE
128,"In China, Property Frenzy, Fake Divorces and a Bloating Bubble - The New York Times","SHANGHAI ” Zheng Ruizhen counted herself among the last holdouts on Lufeng Road. Even as sprang up in recent years to surround her dilapidated home, Ms. Zheng, a schoolteacher, and her husband, Sun Guojian, held firm. He grew up there. Her school was a bicycle ride away. They raised their son there, though he eventually grew so tall that his head grazed the ceiling of his cramped room. When city officials pushed them to sell, they said no. Then came China s latest property bubble ” a frothy surge in prices that could have global repercussions if it pops. In August, an unremarkable piece of land around the corner from Ms. Zheng sold for nearly $2, 000 a square foot, a national record and nearly three times the average land price in Manhattan. Local officials grew more insistent and threatened to tear down their bathroom. Finally, they relented, and Ms. Zheng s husband signed away the home for a price to be determined later. Then, on Oct. 9, Mr. Sun died of a heart attack, something Ms. Zheng said was perhaps influenced by stress over the pending demolition of their home. Now, as she grieves, she is waiting to hear how much the Shanghai government will offer in compensation ” but however much that is, she knows it will not be enough for her to be able to afford to live anywhere close to Lufeng Road. Said Ms. Zheng: I never expected housing prices in Shanghai would get this high. China is in the midst of a dizzying housing bubble. Shanghai s average housing price is up nearly from a year ago, with prices in major cities like Beijing and Guangzhou not far behind. Chinese consumers are rushing to buy homes before the government steps in with restrictions. When rumors swept through Shanghai that the government would require homeowners to pay more in taxes and down payments to buy additional properties, many couples filed for divorce so that one partner could still be treated as an independent buyer. China has experienced housing booms and busts before. And fervor for real estate among the wealthiest Chinese has already spread far beyond the country s borders, from Long Island mansions to disused ranches in Texas ” many to get their money out of the country. But economists warn that the current boom on the Chinese mainland could be extra difficult to resolve: It comes with a growing amount of debt. household loans ” mostly mortgages ” have doubled as a share of total official bank lending this year. They accounted for about 40 percent of all new loans in August, contrasted with just 20 percent at the start of the year. The value of new home loans as a percentage of all housing sales has surged to a record high. The loans ” largely a byproduct of a flood of Chinese lending to keep the economy growing ” are helping the affluent, the middle class and low earners who have dreamed of owning a home, while investors and speculators are piling in, too. Underground lenders ” those who operate outside the formal banking system using a variety of new platforms ” are also helping to feed the boom. Last month, economists at the Bank of China warned in a report that worsening asset price bubbles were adding to a frothy market that could result in trouble. The day before, Wang Jianlin, a politically connected property and entertainment magnate who is one of the country s richest people, told CNN that China property was the biggest bubble in history. That could be bad news for the global economy. Many economists estimate that housing and related areas ” like construction, cement manufacturing or furniture making ” account for roughly of China s economic activity. But if the bubble pops, that support could disappear quickly. Chinese officials, apparently mindful of the 2008 American housing bust, appear to be aware of the risks of a property bubble. But some economists worry they will be too slow to rein it in. The risk is that the government is late in cooling the market, the rally spreads to more areas, pushing up household leverage and construction activity, pushing the bubble bigger, which is then followed by a bigger downward correction, said Tao Wang, the head of China economics at UBS in Hong Kong. Local regulators are already trying to cool things down. In the last few weeks, local authorities have accelerated efforts to tighten housing markets in up to 20 Chinese cities, according to economists at China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank. But in many cases these steps have only added to the rush, as home buyers move in while they can. By her account, Zhang Xia and her husband have enjoyed a happy marriage. Then the rumor swept the city that Shanghai authorities would make it harder for couples with one home to buy more. On a recent Monday, Ms. Zhang, a resident of Shanghai s Huangpu area, and her husband sat waiting at a local marriage registry office to file for divorce. Shanghai officials continue to deny that they will limit house buying by couples, but Ms. Zhang is among many who do not believe them. We know the government said this is a rumor, but they also said that a few times before, when the rumor actually came true, Ms. Zhang said. Some people even said the fact that the government said it s a rumor means it s going to be true. Shanghai, China s financial capital, is at the heart of the property boom. Demand there is so intense that developers now commonly require sizable deposits of cash just to join a lottery to buy a new apartment. Only holders of winning numbers will be offered the chance to buy a unit. One flashy new development in central Shanghai charges a refundable 200, 000 renminbi, or $30, 000, to enter its lottery. In Shanghai now, said Wang Jie, a sales manager there, it s not like you can buy an apartment just because you have money. Back on Lufeng Road, the recently widowed Ms. Zheng and her neighbors try to go about their lives despite the boom going on around them. Men and women play near a house, one of a number of dwellings along the road in various states of disassembly, like a row of rotting teeth. Stray dogs sunbathe and alley cats hunt around piles of red bricks and wooden beams scattered on the street. In recent months, local officials hung red propaganda banners on people s housing extolling the benefits of selling out. No more hesitation means no more disappointment, reads one. Says another: Requisition and compensation are lawful. Smart alecks will regret it later. Look at those banners, Ms. Zheng said, shaking her head. It s almost like the Cultural Revolution once again. Earlier, local officials told Ms. Zheng that the land where her home stands would be used to build supporting facilities for the complex of built by China Vanke, the country s largest property developer. They said that when people who live in the in Vanke look down, the view from their windows is our ugly roofs, she said. So they have to get rid of us.",FAKE
129,Bernie Sanders Just Crashed This Greedy Drug Company s Stock With One Tweet,"It appears that former Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has tanked a drug company s stock with just one tweet. The tweet was directed towards Ariad Pharmaceuticals. Ariad owns a treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia calledIclusig . Ariad has raised the price of the drug four times in recent history.The last time the raised the price of the drug, it went up 27 percent at a cost of $16,560 dollars a month, or nearly $199,000 a year. The price hike doubled Ariad s sales totals up to $65 million dollars in just one quarter.The tweet that was sent out said: Drug corporations greed is unbelievable. Ariad has raised the price of a leukemia drug to almost $199,000 a year. Drug corporations' greed is unbelievable. Ariad has raised the price of a leukemia drug to almost $199,000 a year. https://t.co/EB4nEPxP2G Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) October 14, 2016The tweet also included a link to an article about the company s continual price increases.Bloomberg reports that after Sanders (or most likely one of his staffers) sent out the tweet, Ariad s stock value dropped by as much as 15 percent one of the worst days the company has had in more than a year.At of the time this writing, the tweet doesn t appear to have gone viral compared to many of the Senator s other social media postings, with only 1.1k retweets and 1.5k likes. Though that may change as more attention to the story and Sanders help in making the issue be known grows. Much in the same way that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s tweet sent stocks crashing in the biotech industry after she spoke out against price gouging.Price-gouging in the pharmaceutical industry is a hot button issue. From Martin Pharma bro Shkreli and his raising the price of a certain AIDS medication made by Turing Pharmaceuticals, to Mylan s jacking the price up of EpiPens, people have raised the digital equivalents of torches and pitchforks over these price increases.It s important to keep in mind that this is a problem that is industry wide. One study found that prescription drug prices have been skyrocketing for more than five years. While drug companies that take part in the practice need to be called out and have the screws put on them by the public, the only way this problem is going to end is when people stand up and demand real change in the healthcare industry as a whole. That will probably mean switching to a national health care system like every other developed nation on the planet.Featured image from Alex Wong/Getty Images with tweet screenshot added",REAL
130,Far right wants Austria to join group of anti-immigrant states,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The far right Freedom Party (FPO), set to become kingmaker after elections on Oct. 15, wants Austria to join the Visegrad Group of central and east European states opposed to immigration. Eurosceptic leaders in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have refused migrant quotas approved by a western-dominated majority of European Union member states. They also reject proposed European Union reforms that would transfer more power from national governments to Brussels institutions. The FPO, likely to be a part of Austria s next ruling coalition, also wants a more decentralized EU. We will ... strengthen contact with the Visegrad states and it would be nice and good if we could maybe even become a member of the Visegrad Group, FPO chief Heinz-Christian Strache said in an election debate with Social Democrat Chancellor Christian Kern focusing on curbing migrant flows and Brussels powers. The Freedom Party and center-left Social Democrats are fighting for second place in Sunday s election with both commanding about 25 percent of the vote in the latest polls. The Freedom Party appears ticketed for a place in the next coalition given that the conservative People s Party s rating of around 33 percent is unlikely to improve enough for an absolute majority, and bitter disputes between the two centrist parties. Conservative leader Sebastian Kurz has, like Strache, praised far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for building a border fence to keep migrants out of EU territory. To avoid losing votes, Austria s mainstream conservatives have drifted recently towards the FPO s anti-immigration positions and joined calls to shrink and refocus the EU s powers. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, the EU executive, has invited Visegrad Group leaders to a meeting on Oct. 18 to try to ease tensions between them and wealthier western Europe.",FAKE
131,Americans Don't Like New Congress Any Better Than The Last One,"Since last year, Americans have grown increasingly positive about jobs, the direction of the country and even the president -- but they're not yet willing to extend the same goodwill to Congress.

Just 16 percent of Americans approve of Congress, according to a Gallup poll released Tuesday. That's up from a 9 percent low during the 2013 government shutdown, but virtually unchanged since the end of last year.

""Congress' poor track record notwithstanding, there is reason to believe this Congress will at least be rated more popularly going forward than the last two divided Congresses,"" Gallup's Andrew Dugan wrote. ""Typically, elections that hand control of Congress to one party provide an initial uptick in support for the new Congress.""

A new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds that most Americans think Congress is worse than it used to be, with a majority saying it is less civil and more divided than it was a decade ago.

A 52 percent majority of Americans say congressional debates are less civil than they were 10 years ago, and 58 percent say Congress is now more divided along party lines. Americans 45 and older were the most likely to say things had devolved.

Ironically, the woes of Congress are something partisan Americans can agree on: Democrats and Republicans were about equally likely to say Congress is worse today.

But while ratings for Congress remain low, Americans feel at least relatively warmer toward their own representatives. Twenty-six percent of Americans approve of the member representing their district, while another 26 percent disapprove and the remaining 47 percent are neutral or unsure.

Republicans were by far the most satisfied, giving their representatives a net +17 approval rating, compared to a net -8 among independents and a net +3 among Democrats.

Americans historically have been much more positive about their own representatives than about Congress as a whole, although the percentage who said they felt their own member should be re-elected dipped to a near-historic low in 2014.

132,Strange: Trump ˜Internet Takeover Fear Story Calls For Canada to Manage Net Archive,"21st Century Wire says A red flag went up when we saw this story. We ll let you decide what you think this is Brewster Kahle (photo, left), co-founder of Archive.org, one of the internet s permanent default archive sources, said last week, On 9 November in America, we woke up to a new administration promising radical change, and went on to sound the alarm for Americans to create a safe back-up of the Archive in neighboring Canada (see IBT story below).In actuality, there has been no policy talk of a internet crackdown by the incoming Trump Administration, so where is this talking point coming from, and what does this really mean?Looking past the obvious partisan rhetoric, is this a signal by the Establishment that Canada (British Commonwealth) might be taking over the management of the internet s archive? Another step towards globalization?Aside from the fact that Kahle is opportunistically using an off-handed campaign comment by Trump to drive his latest fundraising appeal, his comments are ill-informed and misleading for other reasons. Granted, Donald Trump made a number of wild and incendiary statements on the campaign trail, and certainly we have seen many people in politics and media taking each of those comments literally, and even inflating them for their own political ends. However, the facts show that internet freedom and state authoritarian policies are not issues limited to any one political figure, or party. State control and attacks on the internet have steadily increased over the last 16 years by both the Bush AND Obama Administrations as members of BOTH parties try to push through new corporate control measures like SOPA, PIPA, ACTA and CISPA, but also across the board efforts to increase warrantless wire-tapping and data collection of all America citizens, as well a foreign ones too.So why single out Trump as the rally cry to move operations north to Canada?The culture in Canadian politics is very much towards globalist power arrangements. Canada is a major backer of TPP and TTIP. We ve already seen Establishment moves to move a number of key internet functions offshore and into transnational corporate hands, specifically with the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN. Here we see a crucial internet function being pushed into the realm of impersonal TPP and TTIP transnational corporate regimes. Make no mistake, the TPP agenda and the ICANN debate are absolutely linked.Consider this. As of October 3, 2016, ICANN seems to have left US public hands, into a transnational collective: At midnight Saturday the United States ceded control of the Internet s address system when the management contract between the Department of Commerce and the non-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) expired. Since 1998 ICANN has run the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function that approves domain names such as .com, .ca, .gov and others. Is state, or corporate control of internet and free speech rights any better in Canada, or in its British Commonwealth overlord the UK? This is where it gets worrying. The Verge reports, The UK is about to become one of the world s foremost surveillance states, allowing its police and intelligence agencies to spy on its own people to a degree that is unprecedented for a democracy. The UN s privacy chief has called the situation worse than scary. Edward Snowden says it s simply the most extreme surveillance in the history of western democracy. The legislation in question is called the Investigatory Powers Bill. It s been cleared by politicians and granted royal assent on November 29th officially becoming law. The bill will legalize the UK s global surveillance program, which scoops up communications data from around the world, but it will also introduce new domestic powers, including a government database that stores the web history of every citizen in the country. UK spies will be empowered to hack individuals, internet infrastructure, and even whole towns if the government deems it necessary. Presumably, and like everything in its Mother Kingdom, Canadian political elites are completely on board with all of that. Moreover, Canada s own bourgeoning police state is very real indeed.Americans should be extra skeptical of any talk of Canada as some uptopian cyber-safehaven. Perhaps it s a better idea that Americans get engaged with these important issues at home, and stand and fight for freedom inside the USA and not capitulate by fleeing to Canada which in the case of the internet, will only play into the hands of the globalists Agamoni Ghosh International Business TimesThe Internet Archive, a US-based nonprofit digital library that preserves billions of webpages for historical record, is preparing to build a backup archive in Canada over fears of intrusion US President-elect Donald Trump. On 9 November in America, we woke up to a new administration promising radical change, writes founder Brewster Kahle in a blog post. It was a firm reminder that institutions like ours, built for the long-term, need to design for change. For us, it means keeping our cultural materials safe, private and perpetually accessible. It means preparing for a web that may face greater restrictions. It means serving patrons in a world in which government surveillance is not going away. The organisation, which relies heavily on grants and donations, is now asking for help from its loyal donors and others who would like to see the Internet Archive last forever without any censorship. This project will cost millions. So this is the one time of the year I will ask you: please make a tax-deductible donation to help make sure the Internet Archive lasts forever, writes Kahle.The organisation, which as of May 2014 had 15 petabytes (1000 terabytes) of data storage, provides free public access to collections of digitised materials. The archive stores web sites, software applications and games, music, movies, moving images and nearly three million public-domain books. Kahle says moving this humongous archive would protect it from efforts to take down specific content. The replica archive will also make it harder to request data on user activity by authorities.During his campaign, Trump had taken a rigid stance on internet censorship and even mentioned that the tech industry needs to close that internet up to stop the spread of extremism. Somebody will say, Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech. These are foolish people, he said earlier...Continue this story at IBTREAD MORE NET NEUTRALITY NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Net Files",REAL

134,WHY ROY MOORE S ELECTION WIN Is Critical For President Trump To Replace Leftist Federal and U.S. Supreme Court Activist Judges,"Tomorrow, Alabama residents (including thousands of felons who have been registered by Al Sharpton s alleged brother) will go to the polls to decide who they want to represent them in the US Senate. The Democrats have contributed over $10 million to their leftist, virtually unknown candidate, Doug Jones. So, why are they so eager to take this Senate seat?In June 2017, the Democrats spent an astounding $30 million in Georgia s 6th congressional district, to lose a House seat in a special election. They falsely believed that the only thing they needed for Democrat candidate John Ossoff to win the race, was enough Georgians who hated Donald Trump to come out and vote.Is history repeating itself in Alabama?Democrat Senate candidate Doug Jones raised nearly six times Moore s amount ahead of the Dec. 12 special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Jones headed into the final weeks of the race with roughly four times as much money in the bank than his GOP opponent.Jones raked in nearly $10.2 million compared to Jones $1.8 million. Jones also spent roughly 5 times as much as Moore during that period, nearly $8.7 million compared to Moore s $1.7 million.Conservative Pat Buchanan asks, Why would Christian conservatives in good conscience go to the polls Dec. 12 and vote for Judge Roy Moore, despite the charges of sexual misconduct with teenagers leveled against him? Answer: That Alabama Senate race could determine whether Roe v. Wade is overturned. The lives of millions of unborn may be the stakes.There is, however, so much more at stake than the single issue of abortion in this hotly contested Senate race. Democrats are not going to sit back and allow President Trump a pathway to remaking the radical leftist judicial system they ve worked so hard to put in place. Today, the GOP, holding Congress and the White House, has a narrow path to capture the Third Branch, the Supreme Court, and to dominate the federal courts for a decade. For this historic opportunity, the party can thank two senators, one retired, the other still sitting.The first is former Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada.In 2013, Harry exercised the nuclear option, abolishing the filibuster for President Obama s judicial nominees. The Senate no longer needed 60 votes to confirm judges. Fifty-one Senate votes could cut off debate, and confirm.Iowa s Chuck Grassley warned Harry against stripping the minority of its filibuster power. Such a move may come back to bite you, he told Harry. Grassley is now judiciary committee chairman.And this year a GOP Senate voted to use the nuclear option to shut down a filibuster of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, who was then confirmed with 55 votes.Yet the Democratic minority still had one card to play to block President Trump s nominees the blue slip courtesy. If a senator from the state where a federal judicial nominee resides asks for a hold on proceedings, by not returning a blue slip, the judiciary committee has traditionally honored that request and not held hearings.Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota used the blue slip to block the Trump nomination of David Stras of Minnesota to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Franken calls Stras too ideological, too conservative.But Grassley has now decided to reject the blue slip courtesy for appellate court judges, since their jurisdiction is not just over a single state like Minnesota, but over an entire region.Not only are the federal court vacancies almost unprecedented, a GOP Senate and Trump are working in harness to fill them before January 2019, when a new Congress is sworn in.If Republicans blow this opportunity, it is unlikely to come again. For the Supreme Court has seemed within Republican grasp before, only to have it slip away because of presidential errors.Both Trump, by whom he nominates, and a Republican Senate, with its power to confirm with 51 votes, are indispensable if we are to end judicial dictatorship in America.

136,White House: ˜Sad That Susan Rice Not Transparent in Unmasking Investigation - Breitbart,"The White House again hit former National Security Adviser Susan Rice for refusing to testify to Congress regarding allegations that she unmasked the identities of Trump campaign aides during the 2016 election.

Sanders added that it was up to Congress whether or not they should subpoena Rice, but that the White House was confident in the investigation. Rice declined a request from the Sen. Lindsey Graham to testify in the investigation into interference in the United States presidential election.

137,"Leon Cooperman, a Billionaire Charged With Insider Trading, Prepares to Fight - The New York Times","Leon G. Cooperman, one of the early titans of the hedge fund industry, is gearing up for the biggest fight of his career: preserving his Wall Street legacy as regulators accuse him and his firm of insider trading. The stakes are high, too, for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which on Wednesday sued Mr. Cooperman, a billionaire, accusing his firm, Omega Advisors, of reaping $4 million in illegal profit by using nonpublic information about an energy deal in 2010. The case is the most prominent to be brought by the agency since a court ruling that narrowed the definition of insider trading. Hours after the civil complaint was filed, Mr. Cooperman fired back with a detailed rebuttal sent to investors. He followed with a defiant conference call, opening with an joke about an man bragging about having sex with an woman. He told investors on the call that he had refused to settle and that he would fight the S. E. C. in court. The stage is set for what is expected to be a legal battle between a gruff, outspoken investor and an agency that has come under criticism for not taking more cases to trial. Mr. Cooperman, the son of a South Bronx plumber, is known for not holding back. In 2011, he wrote a much publicized open letter accusing President Obama of villainizing the American dream and the wealthy. It took me 50 years of hard work and playing by the rules to get where I got. I m not going to let these people destroy my legacy, Mr. Cooperman told investors on Wednesday. Regulators contend that Mr. Cooperman used his position as one of the biggest shareholders in Atlas Pipeline Partners to gain confidential information from an unidentified executive at the company about the sale of one of its facilities to another energy company in July 2010. Mr. Cooperman had assured the executive that he would not trade on the information, but regulators said that despite making that promise, he had his firm accumulate a bigger position and profited when Atlas s stock jumped 31 percent after the sale was announced. The case also involves some family drama. Mr. Cooperman s timely trades indirectly benefited a grandson, whose account Mr. Cooperman managed. Regulators said the money manager bought an Atlas Pipeline bond that rose in value after the deal. And in another twist, Mr. Cooperman s son, Wayne, who runs another hedge fund, may get drawn into the fray because of his own trading in the same stock. In his letter, Mr. Cooperman said his son was prepared to testify on his behalf, noting that his son s fund, Cobalt Capital Management, was betting against shares of Atlas Pipeline at the time and he is one of the biggest investors in his son s firm. Mr. Cooperman said he did not share any information about the sale of the facility with his son. In the complaint, however, the S. E. C. quoted an email that Mr. Cooperman sent to an unidentified relative ” described as the manager of another hedge fund ” informing him of the $682 million deal. This same relative may have been the first to have sounded the alarm about unusual trading in shares and options of Atlas Pipeline the day the deal was announced, according to the S. E. C. In a separate email, the relative writes to an executive at Atlas Pipeline, calling the options trading before the sale announcement fishy and shady. The relative goes on to say that somebody should investigate and then asks: How do I become a . Mr. Cooperman s son did not return a phone call seeking comment. But his firm did buy shares in Atlas Pipeline later in 2010, according to regulatory filings. Wayne Cooperman has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Regulators also contended that Mr. Cooperman tried to conceal his actions after Omega received a subpoena relating to the Atlas trades some 17 months later by contacting one of Atlas s executives in an attempt to fabricate a cover story in the event that either man was questioned by regulators about the trade. Mr. Cooperman allegedly undermined the public confidence in the securities markets and took advantage of other investors who did not have this information, Andrew J. Ceresney, the S. E. C. s chief of enforcement, said in a statement. The civil case against Mr. Cooperman, filed in the Federal District Court in Philadelphia, would appear to sidestep a monkey wrench thrown into some insider trading prosecutions by a recent appellate court decision. That ruling made it more difficult to charge someone with insider trading if the person improperly leaking confidential information was not getting a personal benefit of some consequence. The personal benefit issue would not seem to arise in this matter because regulators contend that Mr. Cooperman misappropriated the confidential information about the impending sale from the unidentified executive at Atlas Pipeline. Ted Wells and Daniel Kramer, his lawyers at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton Garrison, issued a statement in which they called the allegations entirely baseless. Mr. Cooperman said he was being charged with trading on paper gains and added that his firm never sold shares after the deal was announced. He said much of the firm s trading was related to positions in a stock that the firm had been bullish on for many years. In some insider trading cases, hedge fund managers have been forced to shut their firms and return money to investors. On Wednesday, Mr. Cooperman emphasized that 35 percent of Omega Advisors $5. 4 billion in assets under management belonged to members of the firm and that business would continue as usual. He added, however, that if the firm concluded that the S. E. C. case had become too much of a distraction, it would voluntarily give back money. Omega is the second large hedge fund to be rocked by an insider trading investigation this year. In June, securities regulators and federal prosecutors charged a top manager at Visium Asset Management with insider trading. The manager, Sanjay Valvani, committed suicide a week later. Visium s founder, Jacob Gottlieb, whom the authorities did not charge, is in the process of shuttering the hedge fund after selling some of its funds to AllianceBernstein. The two cases show that insider trading remains an issue in the nearly $3 trillion hedge fund industry even after a sweeping crackdown by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. That push led to convictions and guilty pleas from more than 80 people, including Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire of the Galleon Group. Another firm, SAC Capital Advisors, a $14 billion hedge fund, pleaded guilty to insider trading and paid $1. 8 billion in fines to federal authorities. In the civil complaint on Wednesday, the S. E. C. also accused Mr. Cooperman of failing to report in a timely manner information about his hedge fund s holdings and other transactions in publicly traded companies in violation of federal securities laws more than 40 times. Regulators said Mr. Cooperman repeatedly violated federal securities laws requiring investors to disclose when their equity interest in a publicly traded company rises above either a 5 or 10 percent stake. Speaking at a private charity event in June at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan, Mr. Cooperman addressed the looming investigation, telling the Wall Street audience, I call companies, that s what I do for a living. He said: Every time I speak with a company I say the same thing: Don t disenfranchise me if I ask you a question. Don t answer a question if you re not prepared to give anyone else that information, just tell me it s confidential and we ll move on.",FAKE

There are also reports that Capitol Hill police officers and possibly Congressional aides have been injured as well. There is currently no reporting available on their condition. Reports suggest that the shooter was either taken down by Capitol Hill police or taken into custody.The really sad thing about this incident is that this practice was in preparation for a bipartisan baseball game that is supposed to promote unity between the two parties. Further, things would have been much worse if Rep.

I enlisted with LBJ and saw just what a Democrat clusterflock was all about. I went to Vietnam and saw how we were constantly and incessantly bombarded with micromanagement from Washington that got thousands of military people killed. I sometimes wonder if I ll get to heaven, but if I go to hell, I m sure I ll still be a few hundred floors above that bastard Robert McNamara , LBJ, John Kerry, Jane Fonda, and yes, even the hero John McCain.After Johnson abdicated rather than having his ass waxed, I lived through Nixon who was hawkish but allowed the generals (and there WERE a few real generals back then versus now) run the show. He was so out of touch that he never knew North Vietnam was about to surrender when the Paris Accord was presented.Only God could help us after Gerald Ford was beaten by Jimmy Peanuts who d been funded by Saudi money. The military was turned into Section 8 and even the Whitehouse suffered the austerity. Then the light began to shine and Ronald Reagan swept into the fray. He not only loved the country and the military, they loved him back. Esprit d corps was off the scale during his presidency. The Liberals were slowly turning into socialists, however, and about this time all the draft dodgers of the 1960 s who d been given amnesty by Jimmy Peanuts were turning out college graduates with degrees in socialism. Bush 1 was an enigma from the CIA and though he never did much either way, he NEVER DID MUCH EITHER WAY.Welcome to Bill Clinton. Clinton spent most of his two terms wagging the dog and creating the Oral Office, sending a bomber to blow up Quaddafi s tent and killing a goat or two, while allowing the UN to set up the infamous Black Hawk Down situation. He made history by becoming only the second president to be impeached.I actually felt sorry for Bush 2. He was doomed to infamy from the start. He thought most of America was still the rah rah patriots of WWII when they were simply socialists waiting to feed him to the sharks. Then there came the Manchurian Candidate with a faked (OK Democrats, let s say of questionable origin to assuage your PC brains) birth certificate, who d gotten a free ride through college under a foreign student exemption, and whose college records and complete life history had been sealed. (We know more about Thomas Jefferson s bastard children than we do about Obama, Michelle, OR their two kids.) From his inaugural address, he slandered America and within days had begun to encourage dissention of the races as well as slandering police who acted stupidly. That was mild to the crap that would come in doubling the national debt from what had been built by ALL THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS COMBINED, feeding us bullspit about how Muslims built this country, and nationalizing American industries. Fueled by George Soros money and using the Air Force fleet as his personal charters, he appointed malcontents and traitors into positions of authority. He trashed the Constitution by installing czars (interesting he chose a title like that) to bypass Congressional authority. By that time, Congress was completely corrupt on both sides of the aisle. No one had balls to impeach this charlatan. Mysteriously, the lone outspoken conservative Supreme Court Justice suddenly dies in his sleep at an Obama pal s hunting lodge and the Supreme Court is evenly split. Finally, Congress shows some balls and rejects Obama s nomination. The Libtards aren t worried because the fix is in. Soros has paid demonstrators to cause turmoil at all the Republican gatherings, Obama concedes that illegal aliens should vote as they won t be prosecuted, and Soros-manufactured voting machines are caught switching votes in certain precincts. Hillary has cheated her way to the nomination and her lies are completely ignored by the brainwashed minions of sycophants who follow her. But a shocking thing happened on the way to the forum.Middle America had had enough and although the pollsters and the pipers tried to convince them not even to bother to vote, they were fed up with the denizens of the swamp. It was time. Florida was designated a swing state ignoring that all those old retirees living in St. Petersburg, and the fed up Cuban Americans of Miami weren t interested in their platform. Ohio and Pennsylvania, where coal production was blacklisted and where Obama had ridiculed them for clinging to their Bibles and their guns, lay awaiting this supposed landslide Hillary vote and creamed it.The Socialist world of the Democratic Party disintegrated. An American who expressed unbridled love of country and respect for police, firemen, and military steamrolled across the heartland and the liberals realized their scheme was trashed. A CONSTITUTIONALIST would be nominated to the Supreme Court and if the hag who d claimed to retire if Trump were elected would actually leave, the Supreme Court would have a massive majority of CONSTITUTIONALISTS for the next 40-50 years.Now, the same party who d ridiculed Trump on his comments about the election being rigged, started screaming that the election was rigged. They even advocated having the election repeated. They created mobs that burned and pillaged, stopped traffic, threatened murder, battery and rape of Trump supporters, and became the anarchists that the socialist dream thrives upon. They run like castrated pigs for safe zones and use diaper pins as their national symbol.This is exactly what happens when political correctness takes over and participation trophies are awarded to everyone. They can t conceive how disgusting and subservient they have become. Donald Trump may NOT be the best person for the job, but he s such a welcome respite from the candy-assed whimps who ve been running the swamp that it s refreshing to see. At the very least, Donald Trump derailed the Socialist train and bought us precious time. If he only does half of what he s promised, we ll still be legions ahead of where Obama has dragged us. Already countries who held us in contempt are lining up to be found in the favor of America.So for you liberal lurkers and you half-assed fence-sitters, kiss off. You had your big hurrah and now your party is over. For you staunch Republicans in office, don t gloat so much yourselves. You ve been put on notice by the American people that we re fed up with ALL YOU BASTARDS and if you don t start putting America first, you do so at your own peril. You might want to buy a copy of George McGovern s autobiography and see how shocking and humbling it can be for a professional politician to have to try to find legitimate work once he falls from grace.

141,The White House insists it has a plan to fight Islamic State and that it s working,"To its critics, President Obama s strategy to combat the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq is weak and incoherent. Even some of the staunchest U.S. allies and partners in the fight worry that the time for what they see as the administration s incremental approach has long since passed.

The White House maintains that its strategy is comprehensive and that it s working. Sharp increases in airstrikes and Obama s recent decision to deploy Special Operations troops, officials say, are part of a fundamental change in the military s mission developed this fall, along with a new diplomatic push to end the distraction of Syria s civil war.

In his Sunday-night address to the nation following last week s San Bernardino, Calif., shooting, Obama outlined the elements of the strategy, assuring Americans that there is a viable plan underway to decimate the Islamic State where it lives. We will destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm us, he said, using an alternative name for the militants.

But the White House is clearly frustrated by its failure to communicate the elements of that plan and what it believes has been accomplished.

Yes, there is a strategy, Secretary of State John F. Kerry snapped in a speech Saturday. I know the criticism. We all hear them. . ‰. ‰. But that doesn t mean it s wisdom. 

The administration s insistence that its prudence and patience will pay off ” vs. charges of too little, too late ” have been the two opposing narratives of the 18-month battle against the Islamic State and the four-year Syrian war it has now overshadowed.

An examination of the recent course of events on the military and diplomatic fronts and interviews with a broad range of stakeholders and experts provide fuel for both arguments.

For more than a year after the Islamic State blitzkrieg swept across Syria and through Iraq to the Baghdad suburbs in the early summer of 2014, U.S. military operations, including airstrikes and training of local ground troops, were in what a coalition spokesman, Col. Steve Warren, called crisis mode, just trying to keep the barbarians off the gate. 

The Iraqi army had fallen apart. In Syria, as civil war raged in the west, the militants consolidated their control over the north-central and eastern areas of the country, with virtually free access to Syria s border with Turkey to infiltrate tens of thousands of foreign fighters and equipment.

Airstrikes begun by the United States and its coalition partners ” Europeans in Iraq and Arab states in Syria ” were tactical, focused on targets of opportunity and the need to prevent collapse. While domestic critics and allies in the region called for more strikes, more support for Syrian rebels, more U.S. boots on the ground and no-fly zones, the administration demurred.

In a broad assessment in August, the Pentagon determined it had succeeded in its initial goals of stopping further Islamic State expansion and reestablishing the foundations of a viable Iraqi military. Amid repeated failures in Syria to organize and arm a rebel force to fight against the militants in Syria, it found hope in the establishment of a Syrian Kurdish and Arab force that has driven the militants from much of the Turkish border.

Adoption of what the military says is its first real operational strategy, following the chaos of the initial year, was marked by September s change of command of the Baghdad-based headquarters of the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. You have done what was necessary, U.S. Central Command Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III told departing Lt. Gen. James L. Terry.

The new commander, Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, was charged with operationalizing the mission, Warren said.

We always wanted to get into a position where we could apply multiple points of pressure at once, across the whole battle space, said a senior administration official. We re now in position to actually do it. It s not going to be perfect, it s not going to be linear, it s going to be extremely hard. 

Military and administration officials, most speaking on the condition of anonymity about internal decision-making, listed the elements of the comprehensive offensive against core ISIL on the ground in both Syria and Iraq.

In Iraq, the focus has been on cutting Islamic State supply lines into Mosul, the militant bastion in the northwest, in preparation for an eventual ground assault, and applying simultaneous pressure along militant front lines stretching south to the city of Ramadi, 70 miles west of Baghdad. These are not blitzkrieg gains, Warren said, but painstaking, incremental work against a dug-in enemy now made more effective with the ability to integrate airstrikes with a more organized and robust ground force.

Obama has authorized a new, Iraq-based Special Operations task force to conduct ground raids against Islamic State leadership targets in both Iraq and Syria. Administration officials have described a snowballing cycle in which more raids will take more leaders off the battlefield and provide more intelligence to plan still more raids. But it is unclear when the force, initially to number about 100, will be deployed.

Syria, with its separate wars against the Islamic State and between forces of President Bashar al-Assad and rebels seeking to unseat him, is far more complicated.

Regional allies such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, who once flew strike missions along with U.S. warplanes, have largely dropped out, an absence the United States hopes to make up with new agreements with France and Britain.

The whole battle space concept includes simultaneous airstrikes along the eastern border with Iraq to further cut militant supply lines, on Islamic State-controlled oil fields, and in the north-central area, where Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces who have captured a wide swath of territory along the border from the militants are organizing to attack the de facto militant capital of Raqqa.

Obama has authorized the deployment of 50 Special Operations troops, the first official U.S. boots on the ground in Syria, to join those forces to assess their readiness and help develop tactical plans, although the Americans are not expected to arrive for several months, defense officials said.

In southern Syria, anti-Assad rebels have met with significant success against government forces, but the Islamic State, sensing an opening, has begun moving into the area. The United States is sending more money and equipment, including heavy, long-range artillery, to Jordan, both to protect its own border and to engage militant targets inside Syria.

But given the new threat to the homeland, the administration s claims of incremental success have left scornful critics asking why it does not do more. Asked on NBC s Meet the Press on Sunday what he hoped to hear in Obama s speech, presidential hopeful Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) replied: That he s going to change his strategy and come up with a regional army to go in destroy the caliphate in Raqqa. . ‰. ‰. The president doesn t have a strategy. 

Mutual frustration has also been ongoing between the United States, as coalition leader, and regional allies, with some calling for a more aggressive U.S. policy. The United Arab Emirates said last week that it was willing to send ground forces into Syria ” something Obama has consistently refused ” if others would do the same as part of an international force.

But the region s governments, including Turkey, are also deeply divided among themselves, leaving the administration as both whipping boy for their complaints and mediator for their disagreements as it tries to implement a broad strategy. In recent weeks, as Kerry has launched a diplomatic effort to bring the civil war to an end in order to shift attention to the counterterrorism fight, Obama himself has intervened in a series of conversations with regional leaders, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Saudi King Salman.

Nowhere is the dissention more acute than in northwest Syria, where rebel groups separately backed by the United States and Europe, the Persian Gulf Arab states and Turkey are locked in a melange of battles, often beside forces of al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, against Assad s military.

The entry of Russian warplanes and Iranian troops on Assad s side in western Syria has further complicated the situation, increasing the conundrum of how to take back the nearby, remaining 60-mile strip of the Syria-Turkey border in Islamic State hands.

The coalition has said it is ready to launch an all-out air offensive to drive the militants out of the area, located north of Aleppo, Syria s most-populous city, but not until there are opposition forces on the ground ready to occupy the terrain. And the more the rebels are engaged in the Russian-aided fight against Assad, the less willing they are to switch their attention to the border.

U.S. officials say that a small force of opposition fighters in the area, including about 130 Syrians trained by the Americans in Jordan who are in direct communication with U.S. forces, have had some success. But their operations are still rudimentary. To delineate their lines from those of the Islamic State and avoid their own casualties from coalition airstrikes, they light tires on fire and warn pilots to avoid the smoke.",FAKE
142,5 FACTS The Media Won t Tell You About Cops Killing Blacks [VIDEO],"Scholar and journalist Heather Mac Donald toiled away early on in her career at liberal enclaves, but through her street-level reporting on social services and the police, her worldview shifted away from liberal-progressive to conservative.Her shift was not some kind of epiphany from reading conservative principles, but by hearing the voices of welfare recipients who told her government aid becomes a narcotic. Her latest book, The War On Cops is now available for purchase. In her book, she outlines the false narrative that is being pushed by Black Lives Matter and the leftist media that law enforcement officers are Out to get Blacks in America.For almost two years, a protest movement known as Black Lives Matter has convulsed the nation. Triggered by the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement holds that racist police officers are the greatest threat facing young black men today. This belief has triggered riots, die-ins, the murder and attempted murder of police officers, a campaign to eliminate traditional grand jury proceedings when police use lethal force, and a presidential task force on policing.Even though the U.S. Justice Department has resoundingly disproven the lie that a pacific Michael Brown was shot in cold blood while trying to surrender, Brown is still venerated as a martyr. And now police officers are backing off of proactive policing in the face of the relentless venom directed at them on the street and in the media. As a result, violent crime is on the rise.The need is urgent, therefore, to examine the Black Lives Matter movement s central thesis that police pose the greatest threat to young black men. I propose two counter hypotheses: first, that there is no government agency more dedicated to the idea that black lives matter than the police; and second, that we have been talking obsessively about alleged police racism over the last 20 years in order to avoid talking about a far larger problem black-on-black crime.Let s be clear at the outset: police have an indefeasible obligation to treat everyone with courtesy and respect, and to act within the confines of the law. Too often, officers develop a hardened, obnoxious attitude. It is also true that being stopped when you are innocent of any wrongdoing is infuriating, humiliating, and sometimes terrifying. And needless to say, every unjustified police shooting of an unarmed civilian is a stomach-churning tragedy.Given the history of racism in this country and the complicity of the police in that history, police shootings of black men are particularly and understandably fraught. That history informs how many people view the police. But however intolerable and inexcusable every act of police brutality is, and while we need to make sure that the police are properly trained in the Constitution and in courtesy, there is a larger reality behind the issue of policing, crime, and race that remains a taboo topic. The problem of black-on-black crime is an uncomfortable truth, but unless we acknowledge it, we won t get very far in understanding patterns of policing. ImprimusHere are 5 indisputable facts that prove this narrative to be one big LIE:1. Cops killed nearly twice as many whites as blacks in 2015. According to data compiled by The Washington Post, 50 percent of the victims of fatal police shootings were white, while 26 percent were black. The majority of these victims had a gun or were armed or otherwise threatening the officer with potentially lethal force, according to Mac Donald in a speech at Hillsdale College.Some may argue that these statistics are evidence of racist treatment toward blacks, since whites consist of 62 percent of the population and blacks make up 13 percent of the population. But as Mac Donald writes in The Wall Street Journal, 2009 statistics from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reveal that blacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties. Such a concentration of criminal violence in minority communities means that officers will be disproportionately confronting armed and often resisting suspects in those communities, raising officers own risk of using lethal force, writes MacDonald.2. More whites and Hispanics die from police homicides than blacks. According to Mac Donald, 12 percent of white and Hispanic homicide deaths were due to police officers, while only four percent of black homicide deaths were the result of police officers. If we re going to have a Lives Matter anti-police movement, it would be more appropriately named White and Hispanic Lives Matter,' said Mac Donald in her Hillsdale speech.3. The Post s data does show that unarmed black men are more likely to die by the gun of a cop than an unarmed white man but this does not tell the whole story. In August 2015, the ratio was seven-to-one of unarmed black men dying from police gunshots compared to unarmed white men; the ratio was six-to-one by the end of 2015. But Mac Donald points out in The Marshall Project that looking at the details of the actual incidents that occurred paints a different picture:The unarmed label is literally accurate, but it frequently fails to convey highly-charged policing situations. In a number of cases, if the victim ended up being unarmed, it was certainly not for lack of trying. At least five black victims had reportedly tried to grab the officer s gun, or had been beating the cop with his own equipment. Some were shot from an accidental discharge triggered by their own assault on the officer. And two individuals included in the Post s unarmed black victims category were struck by stray bullets aimed at someone else in justified cop shootings. If the victims were not the intended targets, then racism could have played no role in their deaths.In one of those unintended cases, an undercover cop from the New York Police Department was conducting a gun sting in Mount Vernon, just north of New York City. One of the gun traffickers jumped into the cop s car, stuck a pistol to his head, grabbed $2,400 and fled. The officer gave chase and opened fire after the thief again pointed his gun at him. Two of the officer s bullets accidentally hit a 61-year-old bystander, killing him. That older man happened to be black, but his race had nothing to do with his tragic death. In the other collateral damage case, Virginia Beach, Virginia, officers approached a car parked at a convenience store that had a homicide suspect in the passenger seat. The suspect opened fire, sending a bullet through an officer s shirt. The cops returned fire, killing their assailant as well as a woman in the driver s seat. That woman entered the Post s database without qualification as an unarmed black victim of police fire.Mac Donald examines a number of other instances, including unarmed black men in San Diego, CA and Prince George s County, MD attempting to reach for a gun in a police officer s holster. In the San Diego case, the unarmed black man actually jumped the officer and assaulted him, and the cop shot the man since he was fearing for his life. MacDonald also notes that there was an instance in 2015 where three officers were killed with their own guns, which the suspects had wrestled from them. 4. Black and Hispanic police officers are more likely to fire a gun at blacks than white officers. This is according to a Department of Justice report in 2015 about the Philadelphia Police Department, and is further confirmed that by a study conducted University of Pennsylvania criminologist Greg Ridgeway in 2015 that determined black cops were 3.3 times more likely to fire a gun than other cops at a crime scene.5. Blacks are more likely to kill cops than be killed by cops. This is according to FBI data, which also found that 40 percent of cop killers are black. According to Mac Donald, the police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black than a cop killing an unarmed black person.Despite the facts, the anti-police rhetoric of Black Lives Matter and their leftist sympathizers have resulted in what Mac Donald calls the Ferguson Effect, as murders have spiked by 17 percent among the 50 biggest cities in the U.S. as a result of cops being more reluctant to police neighborhoods out of fear of being labeled as racists. Additionally, there have been over twice as many cops victimized by fatal shootings in the first three months of 2016. -Via: Daily Wire Watch Heather MacDonald explain how the lies the media and the Left are pushing about cops targeting Blacks will ultimately harm Black communities:Here is Heather MacDonald s speech at Hillsdale College in its entirety:",REAL
143,Jill Stein Inexplicably Blames The Democrats For Her Meeting With Putin (VIDEO),"On Saturday, Green Party candidate Jill Stein tried to explain why she met with Russian President Vladimir Putin before the election. When asked about the meeting by CNN host Michael Smerconish, she used the most logical defense: blame Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. Because, of course. Take me inside the dinner you had with Vladimir Putin in 2015 and the prominence it afforded you, Smerconish said to Stein. My question is was that in and of itself a form of meddling along the lines of let me give some attention to green party candidate Jill Stein you know the theory any vote for Stein that otherwise would have gone to Hillary. What was that dinner about? Let s be clear, that was a conference, Stein replied. That picture didn t start to circulate until long after the election. It essentially wasn t covered here in the U.S. there was media at that conference, and it was a day-long conference where my message was very clear. It was the message of my campaign. which is that we need a peace offensive in the Middle East. Now, this was a message that was particularly friendly to the Russians. It was saying to them that we need to stop the bombing, they had just begun bombing in Syria. I would have loved for that message to have gotten out but there s basically zero coverage, she continued. It s now circulating. It s funny, Michael, you have to ask why is that picture kicking up a storm right now? I think it s very related to the fact that the Democrats are looking for someone to blame. Naturally. No big deal that she was buddying up to Putin while he was hacking the Democrats and meddling in our election to get Trump into the White House. Nothing to see here folks. Nothing at all.You can watch Stein blame the Democrats for her Russian rendezvous below: Featured image via video screen capture",REAL
144,"Japan's 'Dennis Rodman', ex-wrestler Inoki, urges lower tensions over North Korea","TOKYO (Reuters) - The standoff over North Korea could lead to nuclear war , a Japanese pro-wrestler turned lawmaker warned on Wednesday, urging nations to dial down the tension after the isolated country fired a missile over northern Japan last month. Tokyo could play a role in mediating with its neighbor, said the 74-year-old Antonio Inoki, who is known for fighting boxer Muhammad Ali four decades ago. We are seeing a situation where each raises his fist and the situation is escalating, Inoki, who recently returned from his 32nd visit to Pyongyang, told a news conference, wearing his signature red scarf. It s important to see who can be the first to lower his fist and reduce the tension, said Inoki, who, like U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman, has made numerous visits to North Korea. Pyongyang must commit to denuclearization as a prerequisite for talks, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in an interview with the Nikkei business daily published on Wednesday. On Monday, the U.N. Security Council voted to tighten sanctions on the North over its sixth nuclear test. During meetings with North Korea s top diplomat Ri Su Yong and others on his visit, Inoki proposed that Japan s ruling Liberal Democratic Party send a delegation to Pyongyang, perhaps as a first step toward a visit by Abe, he added. I did make the proposal and was told they would be happy to receive such a delegation, said Inoki, who strode into the news conference as if entering the ring, his theme song blaring. Inoki said he sensed more LDP members were beginning to think dialogue was needed, but admitted the hurdle to an Abe visit was high. Abe and other Japanese officials have said now was the time for pressure, not dialogue. The square-jawed, 1.9-metre- (6-foot-three-inch-) tall Inoki developed close ties with North Korea because his mentor, pro-wrestling legend Rikidozan, hailed from North Korea but could never go home. First elected to parliament s upper house in 1989 from his Sports and Peace Party , Inoki made headlines the next year when he went to Iraq during the Gulf War and intervened on behalf of Japanese hostages, who were subsequently released. Inoki was elected again in 2013 as an independent. Like Rodman, he says it is vital to maintain lines of communication with the isolated North. It s important to keep the door open, Inoki said.",FAKE
145,Juncker: grab Brexit chance to forge a tighter EU,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker urged European Union governments on Wednesday to use economic recovery and Brexit as springboards toward a closer union, built on an expanded euro zone and a pivotal role in world trade. In his annual State of the European Union speech, Juncker sketched out a vision of a post-2019 EU where some 30 countries would be using the euro, with an EU finance minister running key budgets to help states in trouble. Tax and welfare standards would converge and Europe, not the United States, would be the hub of a free-trading world. The EU chief executive stressed his wish to heal divisions between eastern and western states. He sees that as vital to countering a drive, including by founding powers France and Germany, to set up new structures within the bloc that would exclude some poorer, ex-communist members in the east. The wind is back in Europe s sails, Junker told the European Parliament, citing economic growth and the easing of a succession of crises Greek debt, refugee inflows, the rise of eurokcepticism reflected in Brexit - that seemed to threaten the EU s survival. Now we have a window of opportunity, but it will not stay open for ever, he said, emphasizing a need to move on from and even profit from the British vote to leave the bloc in 2019. We will keep moving on because Brexit isn t everything, it is not the future of Europe, he said in a speech that Brexit supporters said showed they were right to take Britain out of a bloc set on creating more powerful, central institutions French, German and eastern European officials made positive comments, but several said Juncker would face stiff opposition. In a carefully balanced, hour-long discourse in Strasbourg, he called on nationalist eastern leaders though not by name to stop defying EU courts over civil rights, and on westerners to drop attempts to keep out cheaper eastern workers or palm off inferior food in poorer national markets. But his core proposal for countering what is known as a multispeed Europe by encouraging all states to join the euro and other EU structures faces resistance in both non-euro zone countries and potentially in Paris and Berlin, where the newly elected President Emmanuel Macron and about-to-be-re-elected Chancellor Angela Merkel are readying their own plans. Macron plans to present his ideas for reforming the 19-nation euro zone on Sept. 26, two days after the German election, a French diplomatic source said. EU officials hope leaders may discuss the issues at a dinner on Sept. 28 before a summit in Estonia. If we want the euro to unite rather than divide our continent, then it should be more than the currency of a select group of countries, Juncker said. The euro is meant to be the single currency of the European Union as a whole. He noted that only long-standing EU members Britain and Denmark have a legal right not to adopt the euro. EU officials say that with Britain leaving, and the eight remaining non-euro states accounting for only 15 percent of EU GDP, Juncker sees it as natural for EU and euro zone policy to operate in unison. For that reason, he rejected proposals, led by France, for a special euro zone budget, finance minister and parliament. These functions, he said, should be filled instead by a vice president of the Commission, chairing the Eurogroup of 19 euro zone finance ministers and managing a euro zone budget that would be part of the budget for the whole EU, overseen by Parliament. While Denmark in fact pegs its crown closely to the euro, a drive to push the likes of Poland and Sweden into the euro would be a hard sell in those countries, while Germany, France and others have been skeptical about letting poorer states join yet. Juncker proposed EU funding and technical help to encourage non-euro members to get themselves into a position to join. For Juncker, officials say, the departure of Britain, for all the difficulties it brings, means goodbye to the major power that has continually sought opt-outs from new integration projects, and offers an opportunity to end the habit for good. Everyone should be in everything, one senior official said. An aide to Macron said Juncker had made many ambitious proposals in line with French ideas and played down divergence on euro zone reform, noting Juncker would offer final ideas only in December. In Germany, government officials were restrained. But Beate Merk, a regional minister in Bavaria allied to Merkel, said expanding the euro to the whole EU would be a risky experiment that would greatly heighten Europe s problems . Euroskeptics responded critically to the Commission president s speech. Ryszard Legutko, an EU lawmaker from Poland s right-wing ruling party, warned against responding to problems with the same old more Europe, more Europe arguments. That is not the answer, he said. We need to get the EU s house in order before there can even be a discussion on centralizing even further. Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party said: All I can say is, thank God we re leaving. Farage s allies cheered when Juncker finally mentioned Brexit near the end of his speech and said the British would come to regret their tragic referendum decision to leave. Looking ahead to March 30, 2019, the day when Britain will be out of the EU, Juncker said he had proposed that Romania, which will then hold its rotating presidency, should host a summit in the formerly German-speaking Transylvanian city of Sibiu. There leaders should set out plans for a more united Union, two months before voters elect a new European Parliament.",FAKE
146,Trump agrees to pay $25 million to settle Trump University lawsuits,"NEW YORK/SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Donald Trump agreed on Friday to pay $25 million to settle fraud lawsuits over his Trump University real estate seminars, in what New York s attorney general called a stunning reversal for the U.S. president-elect. The lawsuits had dogged Trump, who denied any wrongdoing, throughout his campaign. They led to one of the more controversial moments of his run when he claimed the judge overseeing two of the cases was biased because he was of Mexican ancestry. The settlement was announced by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who said it followed repeated refusals by Trump to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. Lawyers for Trump had argued against students, who claimed they were they were lured by false promises into paying up to $35,000 to learn Trump s real estate investing secrets from his hand-picked instructors. Three lawsuits relating to Trump University will be covered by the deal: two class actions suits in California and a New York case brought by Schneiderman. The agreement must still be approved by U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego. Trump will not admit any wrongdoing under the agreement. His attorney, Daniel Petrocelli, acknowledged Trump had previously vowed to fight the case. The settlement demonstrated Trump s desire to set his personal feelings aside in order to work on issues facing the county, Petrocelli said. President-elect Trump has laser focus on moving forward. It s time to move on, Petrocelli told reporters on Friday. Schneiderman and attorneys for the students praised the deal. Today s $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university, Schneiderman said in a statement. At a court hearing on Friday, students attorney Jason Forge said that out of the $25 million proposed settlement, $4 million will be earmarked for students represented by Schneiderman who were not part of the California class actions, as well as administrative costs. Class action lawyers for the students will not seek attorneys fees, but reimbursement for costs, he said. Curiel, who is presiding over the two California cases, had urged both sides to settle. Trump said during his election campaign that Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents, could not be impartial because of Trump s campaign pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to control illegal immigration. In court on Friday, Trump lawyer Petrocelli praised Curiel for his hard work on the case. Curiel said he hoped the settlement could be part of a healing process after the U.S. election that this country very sorely needs.",FAKE

Losing Iowa finally brought Donald Trump back down to earth, and if you re able to gather anything from his latest tweet, it s that he doesn t handle losing very well.

Shortly afterwards, he also posted a cryptic message that made it seem like he wasn t as interested in running for president anymore. Really? Here was what he said, in part: I will keep doing, but not worth it! What exactly does this mean? It must mean he doesn t think running for president is worth it unless people give him credit for things. That, or self-funding his campaign isn t worth it enough for him to be president. Either way, if Trump doesn t self-fund his own campaign he d be beholden to outside groups and special interests, and has already said himself that he doesn t want that. So, according to his own rules, he has to fund his it. There s no other way according to him. And, to make matters worse, it s already been proven that he is, in fact, NOT self-funding his campaign.

149,Fed lowers economic outlook but stays mum on rate plans,"The Federal Reserve lowered its economic outlook Wednesday after a harsh winter chilled the U.S economy's growth, reducing the odds for an initial interest rate hike as soon as the Fed's June meeting.

In a statement after a two-day meeting the Fed gave no clear signal of when it plans to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2006 but policymakers have indicated they expect to act this year.

The Fed statement was released at 2 p.m. ET.

As of 2:55 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was down about 55 points, or 0.3%, to 18,056 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 5 points, or 0.3%, to 2110. The Nasdaq composite was down 17 points, or 0.3%, to 5038. Yields on 10-year government bonds sprang above 2%.

The Fed said economic growth ""slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors."" Unusually cold weather, for example, hindered economic activity. The Fed said it expects the economy to rebound and grow at a moderate pace in coming months.

With that optimistic view, the Fed didn't rule out a June rate increase, as it virtually foreclosed the chances of an April hike in its statement last month. Still, its assertion that temporary factors were only part of the reason for last quarter's slowdown suggests the central bank may want to hold off a few months before hoisting the target range for its federal funds rate, which has been near zero since the 2008 financial crisis.

While a June rate increase ""does not look very likely,"" it ""remains an option if the data suddenly turn much stronger than expected,"" Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist of High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients.

Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said ""it would take something quite spectacular to convince Fed officials to raise rates in June.""

The Fed's statement noted that job growth ""moderated"" and household spending declined in recent weeks, though inflation-adjusted incomes ""rose strongly, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices.""

Business investment, however, ""softened"" and exports declined, the statement said. The Fed added that inflation continued to run below the Fed's target, ""partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports."" Fed policymakers said they expect inflation ""to rise gradually toward 2% over the medium-term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects"" of low energy and import prices dissipate.

A strong dollar has hurt manufacturers' exports and the plunge in oil prices has led energy companies to slash investment.

The government said Wednesday morning that the economy grew just 0.2% at an annual rate in the first quarter, down from 2.2% in the October-December period and below the modest 1% pace expected by economists.

Meanwhile, inflation remains well below the Fed's annual 2% target, with the government reporting that the Fed's preferred measure, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.9% last quarter. That's the smallest increase since 2010.

And employers added just 126,000 jobs in March, compared to average monthly gains of 269,000 the prior 12 months.

The Fed reiterated Wednesday that it will bump up its federal funds rate ""when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back"" to the Fed's 2% target ""over the medium-term.""

The central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate near zero since the 2008 financial crisis, but with the economic recovery now almost six years old, the central bank has been preparing financial markets and consumers for a return to normal interest rate policy. Last month, the Fed dropped a pledge to be patient as it considers boosting the rate, signaling that it could make the move as early as June.

Many economists say the Fed is unlikely to act until September at the earliest so it can assess whether the economy is regaining the momentum it had built last year. That timetable is consistent with Fed policymakers' median forecast in March as well as with recent speeches by Fed policymakers, including Fed Chair Janet Yellen.",FAKE

Read it here: https://t.co/NLczJTxyaz pic.twitter.com/ttqXGx6TxK CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 3, 2017Some highlights:It s up to us to do everything we can (to) build more ladders of success for every child and family that s willing to work hard.It s up to us, through action and example, to sustain the international order that s expanded steadily since the end of the Cold War, and upon which our own wealth and safety depend.[W]e are just temporary occupants of this office. That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.As you can see, President Obama left Trump with a lot of advice he has definitely not followed. From Trump s sustained focus on repealing his predecessor s signature health care bill to his determination to cut social spending in order to fund more tax cuts for the wealthy, he hasn t built any ladders of success. In his constant tweets threatening North Korea and belittling China, Mexico, and even allies like Australia and Germany, Trump hasn t done much for international order. But on the last few points, Trump has failed spectacularly. He has zero respect for the rule of law or separation of powers, and has proven himself an enemy of equal protection and civil liberties.President Obama s letter couldn t have surfaced at a more perfect time to highlight the differences between the man we got used to seeing handle disasters, terrorism, tragedies, and diplomacy humbly and the man-child who scoffs now at even the most common social norms.If only it had been a set of rules.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",REAL
151,Ted Cruz Repeated His Truly Horrible JFK Impression And Got The Quote Wrong. Again! (VIDEO),"For the second time in the last ten days, slimy and loathsome Ted Cruz totally botched another painful impression of the late President Kennedy.You might recall how Cruz first performed a painfully awkward rendition of the Miracle Max scene from the beloved film The Princess Bride, thus nearly ruining the film for all time. There s something wrong in the universe when someone as repugnant as Cruz likes such a fantastic movie to the point where he can recite entire passages in the voices of the characters. The voices were, of course, terrible and he got many of the lines wrong, which once again verified that most conservatives shouldn t bother trying to be funny. They re never funny, even when the source material is stellar.Then, earlier this month, Cruz entertained a small crowd of Iowa yokels with a flop-sweat inducing JFK impression, just after suggesting Kennedy would be driven out of the modern Democratic Party for being too conservative. Regarding the latter, no. First, Kennedy was arguably more liberal than most Democratic leaders of 2016. Second, there are moderate and conservative Democrats who continue to be welcome in the party, including presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton.It s also worth noting that Cruz fumbled the quote. The line he attributed to JFK was actually said by Robert Kennedy years after JFK was assassinated. RFK s line, which was cribbed from George Bernard Shaw, by the way, went: Some people see things as they are and say why. I dream things that never were and say why not? And this is the line Cruz used for his John Kennedy impression.He did it again on Monday.Cruz s verbatim line: During the 1960s, I will point out that one of the most powerful, eloquent defenders of tax cuts was John F. Kennedy. As JFK said, Some men see things as they are and ask, Why? I see things that never were and ask, why not? These are the principles that work. Once again, it was RFK who popularized the line. Not JFK. And no one noticed.Cruz also said that JFK was a champion of tax cuts. This, believe it or not, is mostly true. Kennedy proposed fairly deep cuts to the marginal tax rates at a time when the top bracket was nearly three times higher than it is today.But that wouldn t have forced him out of today s Democratic Party. How do we know this? President Obama is responsible for the biggest middle class tax cut in American history. That s no exaggeration. The infamous stimulus bill, which almost entirely helped to keep the economy from sliding into a Depression, included $282 billion in tax cuts. As a point of comparison, President Bush s tax cuts amounted to roughly $174 billion. Obama s tax cut was also larger than Reagan s cuts.So, Mr. Cruz continues to lie to his people, assuming they re too ignorant to know the difference between JFK and RFK, or the difference between Obama and Kennedy on tax cuts.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rurnz8HuBE&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.",REAL
152,Reforms aimed at making Pentagon acquisition more agile: House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry introduced a second batch of legislative proposals on Tuesday aimed at speeding up how the Pentagon buys weapons and making it easier for firms to retain their intellectual property. Thornberry s legislation follows an initial batch of reforms enacted last year with the 2016 annual defense policy bill, and continues efforts to make weapons programs more transparent. The proposals are aimed at simplifying the convoluted U.S. Defense Department acquisition process, with a big push to fund more experimentation and prototyping of new weapons, while driving to get new technologies into the hands of troops faster. Many big weapons programs are over budget and behind schedule, although Pentagon officials say changes undertaken since 2009 are starting to have a positive impact. The new legislation aims to shorten the time it takes from the start of the design phase of a new program until a military service can start using a new weapon in combat to five-to-six years from around nine year currently, the staff said. The bill requires all weapons systems to have open systems architectures that will allow the services to hold competitions for more components, and carry out quicker upgrades as new technologies are developed. It authorizes the Air Force, Army and other military services to use certain funding to pay for prototype upgrades of components and to develop technology faster. The bill also seeks to end a controversy about how the Pentagon treats private companies intellectual property that has made non-traditional suppliers reluctant to do business with the U.S. military and its complex defense acquisition rules. Instead of automatically giving the government broad rights to control intellectual property rights that are jointly funded by industry and government, the bill would mandate that such arrangements would have to be negotiated between the parties. The legislation would also continue a push to make the military services more responsible and accountable for weapons programs, requiring them to begin overseeing milestone decisions for joint programs after Oct. 1, 2019. The bill also requires the secretary of defense, or his staff, to fix the costs and expected fielding date for new weapons programs, and then hold the services accountable for meeting those targets. To ensure more transparency, the bill also calls for creation of an acquisition scorecard that would compare program cost estimates with those submitted by independent estimators.",FAKE
153,HOLY RIGGED ELECTION! Obama Regime Considers Special Declaration To Take Charge Of Elections! [VIDEO],"If the Obama regime is allowed to wrest control of our elections from the states America better get used to the idea of a President #CrookedHillary Even before the FBI identified new cyber attacks on two separate state election boards, the Department of Homeland Security began considering declaring the election a critical infrastructure, giving it the same control over security it has over Wall Street and and the electric power grid.The latest admissions of attacks could speed up that effort possibly including the upcoming presidential election, according to officials. We should carefully consider whether our election system, our election process, is critical infrastructure like the financial sector, like the power grid, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said. There s a vital national interest in our election process, so I do think we need to consider whether it should be considered by my department and others critical infrastructure, he said at media conference earlier this month hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.DHS has a vital security role in 16 areas of critical infrastructure and they provide a model for what the department and Johnson could have in mind for the election.DHS describes it this way on their website: There are 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof. A White House policy directive adds, The federal government also has a responsibility to strengthen the security and resilience of its own critical infrastructure, for the continuity of national essential functions, and to organize itself to partner effectively with and add value to the security and resilience efforts of critical infrastructure owners and operators. At the time, Johnson did not mention specific security issues, but the FBI has since cited one hack and another attempt.Johnson also said that the big issue at hand is that there isn t a central election system since the states run elections. There s no one federal election system. There are some 9,000 jurisdictions involved in the election process, Johnson said. Washington Examiner",REAL

155,E.U. Offers to Loosen Restrictions on Iran Air - The New York Times,"BRUSSELS ” Almost six years ago, the European Union sharply curtailed access to its airspace for Iran s aging airline fleet. But officials in Brussels say they are now prepared to loosen some of those restrictions as the easing of Western sanctions gradually allows new planes and spare parts to enter Iran after decades of isolation. The overture follows the nuclear accord reached with the United States and other world powers in January, and it will be presented during a visit to Tehran this weekend by a delegation from the European Commission, the bloc s executive branch, officials said. It forms part of a broader European effort to revive economic ties between Iran and the bloc, which was once one of Iran s largest trading partners. Iranian state news media confirmed a visit this week by representatives of Boeing to discuss a possible sale of 737, 787 and 777 aircraft, the first such mission by the American plane maker in decades. The United States company s European rival Airbus reached an agreement with Iran in January over the purchase of $27 billion in new jets. The European Union banned most planes operated by Iran s flag carrier, Iran Air, from its skies in 2010 because of concerns over their airworthiness. With an average age of more than 26 years, the airline s fleet is one of the world s oldest, and European and American trade restrictions had prohibited the sale of the spare parts needed to keep the planes properly maintained. In an interview before this weekend s visit, Violeta Bulc, the European Union s transport commissioner, said that easing flight restrictions on Iran Air was a key priority for Brussels, which is also keen to expand European airlines access to Iran s $400 billion economy. Ms. Bulc expressed cautious optimism that European Union inspections of the airline s maintenance operations, scheduled to begin next month, would pave the way to increase air transport links between Iran and Europe, which she argued would have economic and diplomatic benefits. We need to these connections, Ms. Bulc said. We need to trust. Despite the restrictions, Iran Air has continued to serve about a dozen European cities with 12 planes ” all older Airbus A300 and A310 models ” that have passed the bloc s safety inspections. Another Iranian carrier, Mahan Air, which is privately owned, recently upgraded its fleet to newer Airbus models and flies without safety limitations to several European cities, including direct flights to Athens, Milan and Munich from Tehran. But those air links remain relatively infrequent, and the high cost of operating such an antiquated fleet leaves Iranian airlines at a competitive disadvantage to European rivals like Lufthansa, Air France and British Airways, which have recently resumed or plan to resume direct flights to Tehran. Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations decades ago, and Iran has been seeking a reciprocal resumption of flights with the United States for years. That possibility has been renewed because of the easing of Western sanctions. Ms. Bulc cited air transport as a key enabler of economic growth and credited air services agreements that the European Union has concluded in recent years with several countries in the western Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa with significantly bolstering air traffic between those regions and Europe. Every new destination opens new potential for business development, Ms. Bulc added. The possible loosening of European airspace restrictions on Iran comes at a delicate time, however. The United States has charged that planes owned by Iran Air and Mahan Air have been used by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran to ferry weapons and fighters to Syria in support of the government of President Bashar in violation of a United Nations arms embargo. Ms. Bulc acknowledged the United States concerns but declined to comment further before the commission s visit. I do not at all expect any easy steps to be taken, she said of the negotiations, emphasizing that Europe s dealings with Iran on aviation issues had always been focused on safety, rather than on political concerns. In air transport, safety is the highest priority, Ms. Bulc said.",FAKE
156,Trump says giving Mideast peace 'an absolute go',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he believed we really have a chance to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Trump has faced deep skepticism at home and abroad over the chances for him to achieve any quick breakthrough, not least because his administration has yet to articulate a strategy for restarting a moribund peace process. Trump has described peace between Israelis and Palestinians as the ultimate deal. Peace between the Palestinians and Israel would be a fantastic achievement, and we are giving it an absolute go. I think there s a good chance that it could happen. Most people would say there s no chance whatsoever, Trump said as he began a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York ahead of the U.N. General Assembly s meeting.

158,Iran's Guards flex muscle in Middle East despite Trump warning,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A week after U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a blistering speech about Iran s Revolutionary Guards, the most powerful military and economic force in the Islamic Republic has shown it has no intention of curbing its activities in the Middle East. In defiance of other world powers, Trump chose in a speech last Friday not to certify that Tehran is complying with a pact to curb Iran s nuclear work and singled out the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), accusing Tehran of destabilizing the region. A senior IRGC commander said after the speech Trump was acting crazy and was following U.S. strategy of increasing the shadow of war in the region . Iran s Shi ite militia proxies have made formidable military gains in recent months in Syria as well as Iraq, stretching from northern Iraq to a string of smaller cities and this week, after the Trump speech, re-captured the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. In the short-run clearly Trump has increased the power and aggressiveness of the IRGC, said Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian Studies program at Stanford University. The IRGC can t back down from a street fight. Their domestic and regional prestige is predicated on the fact that they fight a good fight and they don t back down. The day after Trump spoke, the head of the Guards al Quds overseas operations, Major General Qassem Soleimani, traveled to Iraq s Kurdistan region. He held talks about the escalating crisis between Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government after a Kurdish independence referendum. The niece of the late Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, Alaa Talabani, told the al Hadath TV channel that Soleimani met with members of her family on Saturday. He had come to pay respects to Jalal, a former Iraqi president and founder of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party who died this month. Other Iraqi and Kurdish officials told Reuters Soleimani held meetings with Kurdish leaders to persuade them to retreat from Kirkuk ahead of the Iraqi army push into the city. I don t deny that Mr. Qassem Soleimani gave us the advice to find a solution to Kirkuk, she said. He said Kirkuk should return to the (Iraqi) law and constitution and to have an agreement about Kirkuk and give up the intransigence about the referendum which was a decision not thought out. Within days, Iran s mostly Shi ite allies in Baghdad launched a lightning assault, pushing Kurdish fighters out of disputed territories such as Kirkuk and consequently strengthening Iran s hand in Iraq. Commanders of the Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have accused Iran of orchestrating the Shi ite-led Iraqi central government s push into areas under their control, a charge senior Iranian officials have denied. A video posted by the Kurdish Rudaw channel online on Wednesday showed an Iraqi Shi ite militiaman loyal to Iran hanging a picture of Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the Kirkuk governorate office. Iran, which has a large Kurdish minority, has reason to be wary of Iraqi Kurdish independence. It fears it might encourage its own Kurds, who have also pushed for separatism. After the independence vote in Iraqi Kurdistan on September 25, videos posted online showed hundreds of people celebrating in the streets in the Kurdish areas of Iran. FRONT-LINE PLAYER Regional analysts say the emergence of Iran in Iraq, Syria, Kurdistan and Lebanon, where it wields influence through its allied Shi ite Lebanese Hezbollah militia, means Tehran has become a front-line player in the region which Washington could not afford to ignore. Trump s stupidity should not distract us from America s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the (nuclear) deal, we will shred it, said Khamenei. Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region. Speaking after Trump s speech, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards aerospace division, said: From the start of the Islamic revolution ... (presidents) have increased the shadow of war in the region ... Dear brothers and sisters today Trump is acting crazy to gain concessions through this method. The ramping up of tension could put the two countries on a collision course in the Gulf where clashes have only been narrowly avoided in recent months. Small boats from the Revolutionary Guards navy veered close to U.S. naval vessels in the Gulf at least twice this year, prompting the U.S. military to fire warning shots and flares. In August, an unarmed Iranian drone came within 100 feet (31 meters) of a U.S. Navy warplane, risking a crash, according to a U.S. official. Some recent naval showdowns between Iran and the United States took place near the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway where up to 30 percent of global oil exports pass annually. During the presidential campaign last September, Trump vowed that any Iranian vessels that harassed the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be shot out of the water . The Guards could also target U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria through tens of thousands of loyal Shi ite militia fighters without directly acknowledging a role in any attacks. The IRGC can claim ignorance of Shi ite militia attacks against the U.S. military, said Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who has done extensive research on the Guards. In early October, an American soldier was killed in Iraq by an explosively formed penetrator, or EFP, a type of roadside bomb which was often used by Iran s Shi ite militia proxies in Iraq, according to the U.S. military. This is the first time that we ve seen it used in this area, U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a coalition spokesman, said. Dillon said the U.S. military has not yet concluded who carried out the attack. Dozens of American soldiers in Iraq were killed and injured by EFPs used by militia groups linked to Iran after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces, according to the U.S. military. Asked about the threat posed by Shi ite militias allied with Iran in Iraq and Syria, particularly after Trump s speech, Dillon said: We re always assessing the threats no matter where they come from. During certain announcements or certain dates or when certain events happen, we make proper adjustments. Trump s new plan, observers say, will also weaken a group that had made progress in curbing the Guards political and economic ambitions in recent years: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the pragmatist politicians in his cabinet. Since becoming president in 2013, Rouhani and members of his cabinet repeatedly pushed back against the Guards economic influence and involvement in political matters. Now, Rouhani s push against the Guards has been tempered because of the hardening in Trump s approach to Tehran, regional observers said. What this has done is that even those who were critics are now defending the Revolutionary Guards, said Nasser Hadian-Jazy, a political science professor at Tehran University.",FAKE
159,Iraqi PM Rebuffs U.S. Decree That ˜Foreign Shia Militias Should Leave Country,"Ever since ISIS appeared in Iraq in 2014, both the policies and strategies coming out of Washington have ranged from confused to inept, as politicians and Pentagon officials spar over whether or not to cooperate with various Iranian-affiliated Shia militias and People s Mobilization Units (PMF), led by Hash d al-Shaabi and Badr Organisation.The driving factor behind Washington s stance is the Israeli Lobby and Gulf state led by Saudi Arabia who vocally oppose any US cooperation with Shia PMF s in Iraq. This lack of coherency has also helped alienate the Iraq government in Baghdad who appear to be less and less concerned with Washington s sectarian imposition and more concerned with closing-out the ISIS threat in Iraq.This dysfunctional US policy of exclusion in local operational partners on the ground may have helped to prolong the lifespan of ISIS in parts of Iraq. Washington s insistence on playing the sectarian card has led to its inability to openly cooperate with key players to benefit of ISIS.Notice how the AFP report below categorically refers to Shia militia in Iraq at Iranian militias another example of the western mainstream media intentionally skewing language in order to give a false impression that all Shia militias in Iraq are Iranian which is patently false.This week: US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson drew the short straw again, as Pentagon warhawks send him to Riyadh on another impossible mission AFP reports Iraq on Monday rebuffed a US demand that Iranian militias leave the country, insisting that the paramilitary forces which helped it defeat the Islamic State group consist solely of Iraqi nationals. Nobody has the right to interfere in Iraqi affairs, the Iraqi cabinet said in a statement, quoting a source close to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. The fighters of the Hashed (al-Shaabi paramilitary units) are Iraqis who are concerned for their country and have sacrificed for its defence and for its people, it said.On Sunday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson demanded that Iranian militias leave Iraq. Certainly Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fighting against (IS) is coming to a close, those militias need to go home, Tillerson said. All foreign fighters need to go home, he said at a press conference in Riyadh.The 60,000-strong Hashed was formed in 2014 after IS seized swathes of northern Iraq, routing government forces.A coalition mostly made up of Iranian-backed militias, it has played a key role in Iraq s successful fightback against the jihadists over the past three years.It answers to Iraq s prime minister as commander-in-chief of the Iraqi armed forces, into which it has been integrated by a parliamentary vote.Tillerson s remarks were also aimed at Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards and their foreign operations wing, the Quds Force, according to a senior US official accompanying him. The position of the Iraqi government and the position of our government is that there should be a single Iraqi security force answerable to the Iraqi state, the official said on condition of anonymity.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has also hit back at Tillerson s remarks, saying Iran played a crucial role in the fight against IS both in Iraq and Syria. If it wasn t for the sacrifices of the Islamic Republic of Iran Daesh (IS) would have installed its government in Damascus, Baghdad and (the Iraqi Kurdish regional capital) Arbil by now, he said.READ MORE IRAQ NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iraq FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",REAL
160,Sanders' TPP stance shot down by Democrats' platform committee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A trade deal fight led by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday failed to fully materialize as rival and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton announced a compromise to expand mandatory healthcare funding over the next decade. At a meeting of the Democratic Party draft platform committee in Orlando, Florida, on Saturday, supporters of Sanders were unable to influence the committee to adopt strong language opposing the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, marking a powerful blow to the efforts by the U.S. senator from Vermont to push the party further to the left. We did everything we could to win that vote, said Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels. It was very disappointing. Instead of a condemnation specific to the TPP, the committee reached language saying they would oppose trade agreements that do not support good American jobs. Sanders has headed the effort on the U.S. left to oppose the TPP and trade deals like it, which he says are unfair to American workers. Clinton has also come out as opposed to the agreement. Despite Clinton having already secured the requisite delegates to clinch the party s nomination at the July 25-28 convention, Sanders remains in the race to be the party s nominee. He has indicated that he would hold off on endorsing Clinton for the Nov. 8 general election fight against Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump until she adopted policies and campaign language that more closely resembled his own more liberal tone. I would like to say that while this vote was disappointing, we have won some tremendous victories, Gunnels said, including securing language in the draft supporting a federal $15 minimum wage, another trademark issue for Sanders. On the same day, the Clinton campaign announced changes to its healthcare policy proposal, including increasing mandatory healthcare funding under the Affordable Care Act by $40 billion over the next 10 years, highlighting the significant influence Sanders still yields over the party. We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable healthcare to everyone in America, Clinton said in a statement that included her intention to give Americans the choice of a public-option insurance plan and allow for individuals below Medicare age, beginning at 55, to opt in to the U.S. federal program that pays elderly Americans hospital bills. Sanders has made combating healthcare costs a rallying cry of his campaign and often battled with Clinton during the primary race on how best to reach their shared goal of universal healthcare. On Saturday, Sanders praised the updates to Clinton s proposal as a step in the right direction to save lives and ease suffering, indicating, along with the more liberal tone in several parts of the 2016 platform draft, a growing compromise between the two camps. For Clinton, an endorsement from Sanders - seen as a champion of the progressive left - could open the door to many of his supporters who have been reluctant to support the more moderate Clinton. The proposal brought forth today by Secretary Clinton, working with our campaign, is an important step forward in expanding healthcare in America - and expanding health insurance and healthcare access to tens of millions of Americans, he said in a statement. I congratulate Secretary Clinton for this extremely important initiative. The New York Times reported on Thursday that an endorsement is imminent, and Sanders is expected to officially throw his support behind Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, at a campaign stop in New Hampshire early next week. (This story corrects age at which individuals could opt in to Medicare under Clinton plan in paragraph 10)",FAKE
161,One Killed and at Least 2 Wounded in Shooting Near California Polling Places - The New York Times,"AZUSA, Calif. ” A gunman with a rifle was found dead inside a home in a suburb of Los Angeles on Tuesday after shooting at police officers who responded to a report of gunfire and found one person fatally shot and two others critically injured, the authorities said. It was not clear if the gunman ” a man whose identity was not immediately known ” died of a gunshot wound or had been shot by the police, Lt. John Corina of the Los Angeles County Sheriff s Department said at a news conference. We re in the process of trying to figure out why this happened and who this person is and what exactly made him snap, he said. The victim who was fatally shot was a man, but no details were immediately available about him. The two other victims, women ages 65 and 59, were in really critical condition, Lieutenant Corina said. We don t know what s going to happen to them, he said. The episode, which unfolded around 2 p. m. in Azusa, a city about 25 miles east of Los Angeles, took several confusing and conflicting turns as the authorities tried to sort out what happened and to whom. The acting chief of the Azusa Police Department, Steve Hunt, had said at a news conference earlier on Tuesday that the person who did the shooting was a woman armed with a rifle and that the dead victim was also a woman. Asked about the inconsistencies with earlier accounts, Lieutenant Corina said, With something like this there are a lot of rumors flying around and a lot of misinformation going out. He added that so far we have found no evidence of an accomplice in the shooting but emphasized that the police were searching for anyone else who might be injured, dead or hiding. The shooting unfolded as five Azusa police officers and one from nearby Irwindale responded to a report of gunfire on Fourth Street. Chief Hunt said that officers found multiple victims and that as they were tending to them, the officers came under fire. They had to be extracted by armored vehicles. All of the officers who were pinned down by gunfire were accounted for, safe and rescued, the department said on Twitter. The gunman went back into a home and was barricaded there until tactical units entered the house and found him dead. Lieutenant Corina said that the police were obtaining a search warrant to look through the house. The victim who was fatally shot was lying in a doorway outside the home. What set off the shooting remained a mystery. We re still trying to figure it out ourselves, Lieutenant Corina said. After the shooting, two schools were locked down and two polling sites ” at Memorial Park and Dalton Elementary ” were closed, with Memorial Park shut for the rest of the day. Voters should avoid the area and, if necessary, cast a ballot at an alternate polling location, Dean Logan, the Los Angeles County and county clerk, said on Twitter. The police said the shooting did not appear to have any connection to the polling sites or Election Day. Alfonso Mendez, 42, who lives in the neighborhood, said he saw two vehicles crash at the intersection of North Angeleno Avenue and Third Street. A big van and a white car were in an accident, Mr. Mendez said. He said an occupant ran out of the car and started shooting at the cops. Chief Hunt said there was no pursuit by the police leading up to the shooting. The lieutenant said it was not clear how ” or if the crash ” was related to the shooting.",FAKE
162,YOU RE FIRED: Fox News Is Finally Kicking Trump Pal Bill O Reilly To The Curb And It s About Damn Time,"For decades, Bill O Reilly has poisoned the airwaves with his racism, sexism, and right-wing rhetoric on Fox News. Not anymore.The exodus of advertisers from his show on the conservative propaganda network finally tipped the scales against O Reilly. Years of sexually harassing his female colleagues, being a domestic abuser, and lying about being a war correspondent were apparently not enough to justify firing him earlier, but lost advertiser dollars struck the killing blow on O Reilly s pathetic career.New York Magazine reports:According to sources briefed on the discussions, network executives are preparing to announce O Reilly s departure before he returns from an Italian vacation on April 24. Now the big questions are how the exit will look and who will replace him.O Reilly went on vacation after the New York Times revealed that Fox News has spent $13 million settling sexual harassment lawsuits against O Reilly over the years.In response to the revelation, O Reilly played the victim. The worst part of my job is being a target for those who would harm me and my employer, the Fox News Channel, O Reilly said.But the fact that Fox News paid off O Reilly s many accusers rather than fight them in court makes it pretty clear that Fox knew they would not win.Once the New York Times story got out, companies who advertise on O Reilly s show began pulling their ads in droves. The allegations are disturbing and, given the importance of women in every aspect of our business, we don t feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now, Mercedes-Benz said in a statement.And that s pretty much the stance every other company has taken to explain why they are pulling their advertising.Of course, O Reilly had his defenders as well.Serial sexual predator Donald Trump, who admitted he grabs women by their genitals without their consent, defended him. I don t think Bill did anything wrong, Trump said. I think he s a person I know well he is a good person. Trump s decision to weigh in didn t help O Reilly at all. A majority of women in this country fiercely oppose him, and Trump s past statements about women and his past treatment of women was just another example of a sexual predator defending a fellow sexual predator.Fox News is expected to publicly announce O Reilly s departure soon. But they won t say he was fired. They ll make up some bullshit about how this was a mutual decision and they ll say nothing but good things about O Reilly. O Reilly will likely whine and claim that he s the real victim.But the impact of O Reilly s firing will last for years. Conservatives love his show and he was a ratings winner for a network that has started to struggle.Megyn Kelly s departure from the network was a major blow. Losing O Reilly as well will be crushing. Ratings have already dipped and Fox News audience is aging.Fox News and conservatives are going to miss O Reilly. The majority of the country, however, are going to say good riddance.

163,Filmmaker Maria Ivanova: People in Damascus ˜have fear in their eyes,"movies , syria , RBTH Daily , refugees Russian filmmaker Maria Ivanova. Source: Elena Kern / press-photo 
Where did you find the courage to go to the Middle East to make a film on migrants? 
Maria Ivanova: I began making my film in Berlin, in a camp for refugees. I was searching for a female protagonist. But when I arrived, I was told that girls do not flee Syria alone, only with their husbands or relatives. 
In the end I visually began ""capturing"" interesting faces. I found my protagonist “ 14-year-old Muhammad, who was sent by his parents to Germany alone. He did the whole journey alone so that later he could get his relatives out of Syria through the legal process of family reunification. 
During the shooting I understood that next I needed to go to Damascus, where this boy's parents remained. Due to the hassle in obtaining a Syrian visa my cameraman and I traveled to Syria through Beirut. In Lebanon you don't need a visa. Russian journalist in Syria: We came within a whisker of death 
As we were driving along the road I knew that ISIS was only 10 kilometers [6 miles] away, very near. We were driving incredibly fast, 200 kilometers per hour, and when the driver saw a motorcycle coming, the car quickly turned around and headed in the opposite direction. Why? I asked later. Because terrorists often drive around at night on motorcycles. 
That s how we got to Damascus. There was no heating in the apartment we were taken to. No electricity and hot water. We slept on something similar to a couch. There are no real beds in the real East. And at three in the morning I heard bombing. 
Is all of Damascus in this state? 
M.I.: I was in the south and there it was frightening to walk out on the street. People have fear in their eyes, the atmosphere is very heavy. 
In the end did you meet the parents of your protagonist Muhammad? How did you contact them? 
M.I.: They welcomed us with open arms. They fed us. They have all means of communication, they use social networks. After meeting with them we returned to Beirut and went to the refugee camps in Lebanon's mountains, filming there for two weeks. 
Were the Lebanese camps different from the German ones? 
M.I.: Of course. Lebanon doesn t have special conditions. There s a character in our film, a man who has 17 children. He lives in a tent that he has divided into several parts. He patches up the holes. They all sleep on the floor. Despite their horrible position, these people offered us food and played the oud for us [an Arabian musical instrument “ RBTH]. They joked ¦ Their life is based on the hope that they will return home. Of course, many want to go to Europe. They fill out applications. But Europe does not accept everyone. 
In general, Lebanon is an unusual country. Just think, there are 18 religious confessions on a territory that is smaller than the Moscow Region. There are four million residents and one and a half million Syrian refugees. And yet, I never saw a conflict between, say, Christians and Muslims. They all go to the same restaurants, the same movie theaters, everyone is friendly. 
Which films are you taking to the festival in Lebanon? 
M.I.: We finished this documentary film just a few days ago and I decided to hold the premiere in Lebanon, where we shot most of the material. Moreover, our partner, the TV channel RT, is producing two documentary films: Women against ISIS and Sector of Contradiction . The directors of these films are coming to answer questions and hold master classes. 
How much is Russian culture present in Lebanon? Do people speak Russian there? 
M.I.: Many Lebanese studied in the Soviet Union. There is even an association of Soviet university graduates. These people speak Russian, many even married Russian citizens. Furthermore, there are 30,000 Russians living there. There are Lebanese who attend classes and study Russian. Sure, you mostly hear Arabic, English, French. Russian culture is not well known. So we sort of filled a vacuum. 
Is the war in the neighboring country felt in Lebanon? 
M.I.: You still feel the previous war, the civil war. There are buildings scarred by bombings. There are many military personnel, roadblocks, armored personnel carriers, patrols. But next to a destroyed building you can find a modern art gallery, which is followed by soldiers again, and then a modern theater. This is a patchwork country, it is very heterogeneous. Can a low-budget Russian disaster film look like a Hollywood blockbuster? 
Once I was at the Sarajevo Film Festival, which had a really heavy atmosphere. There were no stadiums there. They had turned into cemeteries since there was no space for burying people. While in Lebanon you feel very light. You want to live, despite certain moments ¦ The presence of soldiers, on the contrary, creates the feeling of security. 
I traveled there by car with a driver, saw beautiful cities, mountains, wine production. I went to an apple festival. I wasn t afraid. The country has a modern airport, taxis, hotels, wonderful restaurants, beaches and movie theaters. But the thing is that no one anywhere will give you 100-percent guaranteed security, including when you're driving through France or Germany. In terms of security, Lebanon is no different than Europe.

164,WATCH: Sean Spicer Just Made Trump s Wiretap Accusation Look Like The Lie That It Is,"For a week now, the world has been up in arms about Trump accusing former President Obama of wiretapping his tower to spy on his White House campaign. The House Intelligence Committee has demanded Trump turn over any and all evidence he s got that supports that accusation, and there s also the possibility that he s committed obstruction of justice just by tweeting about it.So, of course, the White House press corps was asking Sean Spicer about all of this during today s press briefing. He said: The president made very clear in his tweet that it was wiretapping. Those quotation marks above aren t an accident. Watch what he did below:Basically, Spicer stood at the podium in the White House press room, in front of the press corps, and put air quotes around the word wiretapping. Air quotes tend to serve the same purpose as scare quotes in writing they re used to create doubt around a word or phrase. Spicer just put doubt around Trump s accusation of wiretaps. Literally.Now, it s entirely possible that Spicer just thought he was placing emphasis on wiretapping, or that he s just clueless enough not to know what air quotes like that imply. But it doesn t matter what he thought he was doing. It matters what he did, and he just cemented the doubt surrounding Trump s wiretap accusation.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",REAL
165,Learning Horrors of War from Vets,"Learning Horrors of War from Vets November 9, 2016 
Americans shed some guilt for sending young soldiers to war by saying thank you for your service but it d be better to ask vets about their war experiences, says ex-U.S. Army chaplain Chris J. Antal who served in Afghanistan. 
By the Rev. Chris J. Antal 
Veteran s Day too often only serves to construct and maintain a public narrative that glorifies war and military service and excludes the actual experience of the veteran. This public narrative is characterized by core beliefs and assumptions about ourselves and the world that most citizens readily accept without examination. 
The U.S. public narrative reconciles deep religiosity with a penchant for violence with an often unexamined American National Religion. The core beliefs of this religion include the unholy trinity of governmental theism (One Nation Under God, In God We Trust, etc.), global military supremacy, and capitalism as freedom. These core beliefs provide many U.S. citizens with a broad sense of meaning and imbue the public narrative with thematic coherence. U.S. Marines patrol street in Shah Karez in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by Staff Sgt. Robert Storm) 
War is a Force that Gives Us Meaning , as Christopher Hedges wrote. Yet this kind of coherence has a moral and psychological cost. The consequence of an unexamined faith in American National Religion is a moral dualism that exaggerates U.S. goodness and innocence and projects badness on an other who we then demonize as the enemy and kill. 
Walter Wink described this moral dualism as a theology of redemptive violence, the erroneous belief that somehow good violence can save us from bad violence. 
Veteran s Day, in the context of American National Religion, enables selective remembering, self-deception, and projected valorization. In short, it serves to perpetuate lies in order to avoid facing uncomfortable truths about who U.S. citizens are and what kind of people we are becoming. 
Imagine a Veteran s Day where citizens gathered around veterans and asked, what s your story? Citizens who risk this bold step begin to bridge the empathy gap between civilians and veterans and open up the path for adaptive change and post-traumatic growth. 
I believe one citizen who approaches a veteran with the invitation, what s your story? does more for the veteran than a thousand patriotic platitudes like Thank you for your service could ever do. 
Only a First Step 
Asking the question is only the first step. A citizen who wants to give back to veterans should cultivate narrative competence, the capacity to recognize, absorb, interpret, and be moved by the stories one hears or reads. The voice of veterans, if we open our ears to hear them, often provides an essential counter-narrative to the U.S. public narrative. Coffins of dead U.S. soldiers arriving at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware in 2006. (U.S. government photo) 
Violent, sudden, or seemingly meaningless deaths, the kind of deaths often experienced by veterans, can make the world appear dangerous, unpredictable, or unjust. The experience of warfare can often undercut our sense of meaning and coherence and shatter assumptions. Because of this many veterans carry a depth of pain that is unimaginable to many citizens. 
The voice of the veterans often reveals uncomfortable truths and invites collective examination of core beliefs and assumptions, especially those that form the bedrock of American National Religion. 
Imagine a Veteran s Day where communities join together for authentic dialogue between veterans and civilians. Such a gathering would empower veterans to share the kind of stories that would help the community face real problems. What new story might emerge in the process? How might we become a better people as a result? 
The Reverend Chris Antal was a chaplain with the US Army in Kandahar, Afghanistan and later in the US Army Reserve. While in Afghanistan, he delivered a sermon that said, We have sanitized killing and condoned extrajudicial assassinations ¦ He nearly lost his job. This past April, in an open letter to President Obama, he resigned his commission in protest over the use of drones, nuclear proliferation and our government s claims of impunity to international law.

The coin features Trump s face and the Statue of Liberty is on the flip side. The coin includes the slogan In Trump we trust. Well, Russia certainly trusts Trump more than American citizens do. Trump will enter the Oval Office with the worst approval rating in modern history for a president-elect.Only 45 of the limited-edition coins have been made.Image: screen capture via Associated Press. The man in charge of Art-Grani, spoke with the the Associated Press Television News and said the coins were designed to express his and other Russian business leaders hopes associated with Trump. Vladimir Vasyukhin s company is about 650 miles east of Moscow, in south-central Russia s Chelyabinsk region. He said, there are more hopes associated with Trump with regards to the lifting of sanctions; maybe the environment (between the U.S. and Russia) will change. CBS reports:Mr. Trump even suggested in an interview with the Times of London several days ago that he might be willing to drop some of the sanctions against Moscow in exchange for an agreement on nuclear arms reduction. Moscow s reaction to the proposal was muted, and on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he didn t actually see it as a proposal from the incoming president.Five of the commemorative coins will be cast in silver and the others will be cast in gold.They measure almost five inches in diameter and weigh about two pounds each, similar to coins made by the company featuring Putin and other notable Russians.Watch:We re wondering when the president-elect s accent will start changing to Russian. Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader who is very smart. Vasyukhin said the coins will sell for thousands of dollars and added that his company would like to give the first coin to Trump. Maybe Trump could use the coin to pay back some of the money he owes to Russian banks.Coincidentally, Ann Coulter authored a book titled, In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!

167,O Malley Comes Out Swinging At DNC: ˜To Hell With Trump s American Nightmare (VIDEO),"Former Maryland Gov. Martin O Malley came out swinging at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday. He denounced Donald Trump as a bully and a racist who makes his followers fearful of tomorrow and feeds off of a deep-seated and dangerous anger. I say to hell with Trump s American nightmare, O Malley said. We believe in the American Dream. O Malley praised Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, saying they were as tough as they come. He compared the Democratic ticket with the Republican nominee, who turns anger into a political weapon. Anger never fed a hungry child, did it? Anger never protected a family s home or sent a kid to college. Anger never built a great republic, said O Malley.O Malley slammed Trump for his insistence that wages are too high, a stance the billionaire candidate did an about face on today even though he had argued vehemently against a minimum wage hike during a Republican presidential debate in November. Wages are too high? O Maller asked incredulously. Really Donald? I ll tell you what s too high. College tuition is too high. I ll tell you what s too high. The cost of childcare, that s too high. The number of American children who live in poverty, that s too high. Donald Trump s opinion of himself way, way too high, O Malley quipped.The former governor then ripped apart Trump s ridiculous assertion that the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese. I ll tell you what: If the Chinese were really capable of designing some kind of diabolical farce to hurt America, they wouldn t invent global warming, he said. They d invent Donald Trump. O Malley then said that Trump has been a bully his whole life. But here s what I learned on playgrounds in Catholic school: all bullies are cowards in disguise, O Malley said. But unlike that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton actually knows the enduring symbol of America is not a barbed wire fence, he remarked. It is the Statue of Liberty.

169,"Argentina's Macri vows to pursue tax, labor, pension reforms","BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina s President Mauricio Macri vowed to press ahead with reforms to the country s tax, labor and retirement systems in a speech on Monday, a week after his Let s Change coalition swept to victory at the polls in midterm elections. The government will present a tax reform proposal this Tuesday or Wednesday, and an amnesty plan for companies that hired workers informally in the coming days, Macri said. He added that the government would convene a commission to propose changes to the retirement system in coming weeks. The speech marked a roadmap for the second half of Macri s four-year term, as he seeks to implement business-friendly reforms to attract investors who avoided the country during more than a decade of populist rule. We need lower taxes, more public works, and all this we need to achieve with fiscal balance, Macri told a gathering of lawmakers, governors, union leaders, judges and others. Investors have been encouraged by the reforms Macri has implemented since taking office in December 2015, including lifting foreign exchange controls, settling with holdout creditors, and lowering export taxes. But significant investment has not arrived. Companies have demanded lower costs, while credit agencies are concerned about a deep fiscal deficit. Macri s coalition swept the five most populous areas in midterm elections, giving him a broader mandate to pass reforms, though it still lacks majorities in both chambers of Congress. Macri said his government had reduced the country s tax burden, and wanted to make the system simpler, clearer, and fairer. He reiterated the government s aim of slashing Argentina s fiscal deficit by one percentage point of gross domestic product per year. And he also vowed to reform the country s retirement system, a large driver of government spending. We need to start a mature and honest conversation about our retirement and pension system, Macri said. Our retirement system hides serious inequities, and it is not sustainable. While Macri has said he does not plan major changes to the country s labor code, he has said the government plans to provide incentives to companies to formalize undeclared workers and work with unions in specific sectors to lower costs. Macri also pledged reforms to the country s justice system to combat corruption. Cabinet Chief Marcos Pena told journalists that the resignation on Monday of chief prosecutor Alejandra Gils Carbo, appointed during the former administration of President Cristina Fernandez, was a step towards making the judiciary more independent.",FAKE
170,Hannity Rips NBC For Corporate Jihad Against President Donald Trump - Breitbart,"Wednesday for his show s Opening Monologue, Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity took aim at NBC News a day after Rachel Maddow, host of MSNBC s The Rachel Maddow Show, released President Donald Trump s 2005 taxes. Hannity categorized Maddow s effort as being part of what he called the propaganda media and offered other examples in addition to Maddow of attacks on Trump. Partial transcript as follows: NBC s corporate jihad against President Donald Trump continues. Plus, a new report from Circa News shows the investigation into a server connected to Donald Trump was, in fact, a politically motivated hit job pushed by a Hillary Clinton donor. By the way, that s tonight s Opening Monologue. All right, NBC has now hit a new low by releasing the president s tax returns, or a small portion of them, last night. But what we re seeing from the alt left propaganda destroy Donald Trump media ” it s not new. Now that Donald Trump occupies the Oval Office, the opposition party press is going to new extremes and lows to try and take down his presidency, and they won t stop until he s out of office. Now, I ve been saying since 2008 right here on this program journalism is dead. Now it s in the ground, buried, flowers on top. And last night s political hit job by NBC is just the latest example in the media s long list of attacks against the president. Here s just a small sampling. (END VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here you have a deranged president, or a pathologically lying president, lying about the operations of the American government and lying about the previous president of the United States. That s enough to invoke the 25th Amendment, but Mike Pence and the cabinet are not there yet. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When he said today America first, it was not just a racial ” I mean, I shouldn t say racial, the Hitlerian background to it ¦ UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I understand why so many people voted for him. I understand where you were coming from. I understand why you liked him. But this man is lying to you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump s critics, those who are worried about this president and this White House, saw a live special television event brought to you by narcissism, thin skin, chaos and deeply personal grievances. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was a whitelash. This was a whitelash against a changing country. It was a whitelash against a black president in part. And that s the part where the pain comes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a really sad night. I m just going to say it. This is a very sad night for the country. You can t polish this turd. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don t know ” are you using the word lie or falsehood? What are you ” what are you ¦ UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, I think you have use ” the word ” the word ” you have to call it what it is. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was interesting because I saw Sean Spicer on FOX News, and he said that you were rude. And I thought ¦ (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What if you had called him a fake president? (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Beyond awful. And when the alt left propaganda media isn t doing what you just saw and attacking the integrity and mental health of the president, well, they re running wild all kinds of bizarre conspiracy theories about the Trump campaign colluding with the Russians. Now, what the biased press refuses to tell you ” there is zero ” no evidence whatsoever that shows any kind of collusion. Well, that didn t stop the leader of the propaganda media, Rachel Maddow herself, from going off the deep end last night, claiming that in 2005, a Russian oligarch knew that Donald Trump was going to be president, so he bought a property from him in Florida and Trump made a huge profit, more than two times what he paid for it! And as I said last night, Maddow thinks that somehow, maybe Russia knew in 2005 that Donald Trump would be elected president in 2016. Unfortunately, NBC News didn t think that was possible even on election night. Now, that s pretty pathetic, and the media should know better, but they d rather put their radical agenda than telling the truth to the American people. That s why they never vetted Obama. That s why they colluded with Hillary. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",FAKE
171,Reaction to death of U.S. Justice Scalia,"(Reuters) - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has died, setting up a major political showdown between President Barack Obama and the Republican-controlled Senate over who will replace the jurist just months before a presidential election. Following is reaction to Scalia s death. For almost 30 years, Justice Antonin ˜Nino Scalia was a larger-than-life presence on the bench, a brilliant legal mind with an energetic style, an incisive wit and colorful opinions. I plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time. There will be plenty of time for me to do so and for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote. These are responsibilities that I take seriously, as should everyone. They re bigger than any one party. They are about our democracy. They re about the institution to which Justice Scalia dedicated his professional life and making sure it continues to function as the beacon of justice that our founders envisioned. He was a towering figure and important judge on our nation s highest court. He brought intellect, good judgment, and wit to the bench, and he will be missed by his colleagues and our country. He was an extraordinary individual and jurist, admired and treasured by his colleagues. His passing is a great loss to the Court and the country he so loyally served. The American people Ž should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president. The president can and should send the Senate a nominee right away. With so many important issues pending before the Supreme Court, the Senate has a responsibility to fill vacancies as soon as possible. It would be unprecedented in recent history for the Supreme Court to go a year with a vacant seat. Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senate s most essential Constitutional responsibilities. REPUBLICAN SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN Given the huge divide in the country, and the fact that this president, above all others, has made no bones about his goal to use the courts to circumvent Congress and push through his own agenda, it only makes sense that we defer to the American people who will elect a new president to select the next Supreme Court justice. SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY, RANKING DEMOCRAT ON SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE The Supreme Court of the United States is too important to our democracy for it to be understaffed for partisan reasons. It is only February. The president and the Senate should get to work without delay to nominate, consider and confirm the next justice to serve on the Supreme Court. Unless (Obama) can find a consensus choice, the next president will pick the replacement for Justice Scalia ... If we lose the election, Hillary Clinton is going to pick somebody that I wouldn t pick. I m telling every conservative now, don t expect to lose the election and still get your way. I think it is too late to nominate someone now. He (Obama) has every right to nominate but it will be up to the Senate to evaluate that nomination ... and decide whether to move forward with it. My hope is that the president will promptly nominate someone with strong intellect and integrity who can win bipartisan support. I will work vigorously as a member of the Judiciary Committee to achieve confirmation. The Republicans in the Senate and on the campaign trail who are calling for Justice Scalia s seat to remain vacant dishonor our Constitution. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility here that it cannot abdicate for partisan political reasons. While I differed with Justice Scalia s views and jurisprudence, he was a brilliant, colorful and outspoken member of the Supreme Court. He was a justice who did not believe in legislating from the bench and he is a person whom I held in the highest regard and will always greatly respect his intelligence and conviction to uphold the constitution of our country. As liberals and conservatives alike would agree, through his powerful and persuasive opinions, Justice Scalia fundamentally changed how courts interpret the Constitution and statutes, returning the focus to the original meaning of the text after decades of judicial activism. One of the greatest honors in my life was to attend oral arguments during Town of Greece v. Galloway and see Justice Scalia eloquently defend religious freedom. His logic and wit were unparalleled, and his decisions were models of clarity and good sense. I often said he was my favorite justice because he took the Constitution, and the responsibility of judges to interpret it correctly, with the utmost seriousness. OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE His death is a serious loss to our nation and the court. He was an essential, principled force for conservative thought and is a model for others to follow. It is imperative that the Senate not allow President Obama to diminish his legacy by trying to nominate an individual who would carry on his wishes to subvert the will of the people. I expect they will nominate a replacement and the Senate will refuse to take it up. From a policy standpoint, a lot of knotty decisions that might have been 5-4 will now be tied and, assuming the Senate won t act, the lower court rulings will stand. That means on immigration, for example, the Fifth Circuit ruling invalidating the president s order may prevail.",FAKE
172,Police reveal names of Orlando club shooting victims,"Orlando, Fla. (Reuters) - A day before the Orlando, Florida, nightclub massacre, Luis Vielma, 22, updated his Facebook profile with a picture of himself standing with young people in front of a Disney castle and a caption that read: True friends who become family. By Sunday night, his profile was altered to Remember Luis Vielma after police confirmed he was among 50 people killed in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. As authorities frantically tried to notify all the relatives, the Orlando Police Department began publishing the names of victims on a city website on Sunday afternoon. Among them was Vielma, who worked part-time as a rides attendant at the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey theme park ride, while studying physical therapy at Seminole State College, according to his Facebook profile. Others included Edward Sotomayor Jr., 34, Stanley Almodovar III, 23, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, 20, Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22, Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36, and Peter O. Gonzalez-Cruz, 22. Police killed the gunman, who was identified as Omar Mateen, 29, a New York-born Florida resident and U.S. citizen who was the son of immigrants from Afghanistan, and officials were probing evidence suggesting the attack may have been inspired by Islamic State militants. The sheer number of deaths appeared to overwhelm officials in Orlando, a city of 270,000 people. Orlando police asked mourners to hold off on vigils as they were understaffed to police them. We understand our community is grieving and that vigils are being planned but PLEASE hold off on vigils “ they represent a serious strain on our limited resources, which we need to dedicate to law enforcement and victims, the city posted on its official Twitter handle. Sotomayor was a marketing manager at a Sarasota, Florida-based gay-themed travel company. His boss, Al Ferguson, said Sotomayor s partner was outside the nightclub putting something in the car when the shots rang out. He got a text from Sotomayor telling him he was safe in the bathroom and not to come back into the club. Sotomayor texted again 20 minutes later to say he was OK. That was the last his partner heard from him, Ferguson said. Sotomayor was a legend in the industry, Ferguson said. He booked tours for entertainer and drag queen RuPaul and put together the first gay cruise to Cuba last year. He was going to announce a second trip on Sunday, but was killed. Anyone who booked gay cruises knew Sotomayor, Ferguson told Reuters. He was a great man. In an Instagram post published on Sunday, RuPaul s Drag Race judge Michelle Visage called Sotomayor a joy. I loved you on so many levels. You were SO SO special and will never be forgotten, she wrote. I promise you that. Neighbors of Almodovar, a 23-year-old pharmacy technician, said his parents had recently moved back to Puerto Rico after his mother became ill with cancer. He was the youngest in the family. The Facebook page for Almodovar, of Clermont, Florida, was flooded with shocked tributes. We ll miss you Stanley. You made an impact on everyone that you came around. A good person and friend, wrote Mark Nielsen of Deltona, Florida. Images posted to Almodovar s wall over the years showed him socializing with dozens of friends. I will always remember you, Jeannette Molina wrote. Your beautiful personality and spirit.",FAKE

After being impeached by the House, the Senate wound then hold a trial to determine his guilt.The congressman goes on to explain, that the House has no choice but to impeach Trump after he fired Comey, admitted he considered the Russia investigation when deciding whether to relieve the FBI director of his duties and then proceeded to threaten Comey publicly via Twitter.These acts, when combined, amount to intimidation and obstruction.Green called for Trump s impeachment by the House of Representatives one more time, then closed his statement with this sentiment: Our mantra should be I.T.N. Impeach Trump Now.' Although many Democrats have discussed the possibility that Trump s presidency might end in impeachment, Green is only the second congressman to explicitly call for his impeachment. The first was Maxine Waters, who has been calling for Trump to be impeached for months now.Inbox: Congressman Al Green Calls for the Impeachment of President Trump pic.twitter.com/TUBoNaUJr6 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) May 15, 2017Featured image via AlGreen.House.Gov",REAL
175,Lebanese army to get $120 million in U.S. aid,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The United States, which wants to prevent violence spilling over from Syria into Lebanon, will give the Lebanese army $120 million more in aid to boost border security and counter-terrorism work, the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon said on Wednesday. Lebanon will get six MD 530G light attack helicopters, six Scan Eagle drones, and communication and night vision equipment under the new programs, Ambassador Elizabeth Richard said after she met Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. The United States has given the Lebanese Armed Forces more than $1.5 billion in assistance over the past ten years, the Embassy has said previously. The United States hopes to strengthen the Lebanese army to stop the spread of violence over the border from neighboring Syria and help it become the sole military force defending the country. Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah group, which Washington regards as a terrorist organization, is a powerful military force in the country and also fights in Syria for President Bashar al-Assad. Lebanon hosts around 1.5 million Syrian refugees.",FAKE
176,NOTHING BIG MAC: Donald Trump Jr Caught in Latest Russiamania Ragbag,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireDespite repeated failures in litigating the Russian Collusion case, America s mainstream media and liberal establishment are still trying to manifest new episodes, hoping that one will turn up Trump.What was billed by the US mainstream media this week as a smoking gun, still hasn t produced anything remotely compelling, not by normal journalistic standards anyway.At first it looked salacious and on first read had all the makings of a Russo-American sequel to Get Shorty Last summer, well before Russiamania descended upon the US media and body politic, a former Trump Organization and entertainment agent associate, Rob Goldstone, emailed Donald Trump Jr about an interesting meeting in Trump Tower. Goldstone laid the bait, according to an email chain released by Donald Trump Jr this week, indicating that the purpose of the meeting was as follows: to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government s support for Mr Trump. No doubt intriguing, to which Trump the younger replied: If it s what you say I love it especially later in the summer. At last, no more vegan news. Russiagate has finally served up some red meat, and so it began.In a personal statement released on Monday by Donald Trump Jr, he maintained his innocence regarding the matter: The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research. Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent went nowhere but had to listen. https://t.co/ccUjL1KDEa Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 10, 2017By that time the media had already made the jump to hyperspace. The headlines all hummed in unison, gleefully touting along the lines of, At last, they all thought, after 10 months and hundreds of millions of dollars spent, and public money wasted, and thousands of hours of hollow media coverage we ve finally got it! If the media is to believed, you d think that every Trump-Russia story is a precursor for his impeachment.If there s one thing we ve learned from the media by now, it s that even if it s an obvious cul-de-sac, they can still sustain a Trump-Russian story for most of the working week. Just this morning, an enthusiastic Washington Post, still going strong, pushed out the headline which read: Category 5 hurricane : White House under siege by Trump Jr. s Russia revelations. Not surprisingly, CNN was just as determined, like a dog searching for its chew toy under the couch. CNN breaking news voiceover presenter announced loudly, Another potential bombshell report from the New York Times the key word here being potential, but that s already a stretch. There are plenty in the media who would like there to be something there, but to paraphrase one of the great political eels of all time, Donna Brazile There is no there, there. While pushing the story on Tuesday, CNN s lead paragraph was keen to stress that President Donald Trump s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, met a Russian government attorney even though everyone already knew by that time that the attorney in question, Natalia Veselnitskaya, had already stated she had never acted on behalf of the Russian government.Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya (Source: The Australian) According to Donald Trump Jr s own personal statement and email chain released on Twitter, Russian lawyer Veselnitskaya produced no useful dirt on Hillary Clinton at the supposedly magnanimous meeting in Trump Tower and claims the meeting was really about the Magnitsky Act, signed by President Barack Obama in 2012 which contained targeted sanctions against Russian individuals and which also put the brakes on US-Russia adoptions. At the time we were told that Russian President Vladimir Putin viewed the Act as an affront to Russian national interests and retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children.The Magnitsky Affair became the cause de jour for the West as well as the opening salvo in the New Cold War, but according to veteran investigative reporter Robert Parry the real details of this scandal have been purposefully blocked from Western eyes and ears. Instead, a mythology has been perpetuated which persists to this day thanks to the efforts of one of the scandal s protagonists, hedge-fund operator William Browder.Beyond the palace intrigue and the Magnitsky angle, no mainstream journalists seem brave enough to ask the simple question: is there a story here? In the end, no information was passed to Trump, and no crime appears to have been committed. It s not just a nothing burger, it s a nothing Big Mac.Staying to the task at hand, the New York Times kept establishment s Russiamania on track. Right on queue, the New York Times responded to Trump Jr s email release by trying elevate the alleged incident to the level of Russian collusion with its headline, When the Kremlin Says Adoptions, It Means Sanctions . CNN also used the opportunity to recycle and repeat what should be by now a discredited piece of fiction by crowing, The US intelligence community concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed an influence campaign to hurt Clinton and help Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign Apparently, unhinged editors at CNN are still asleep to the fact that the New York Times had already jettisoned the 17 agencies fable when they retracted their yarn ten days previous:After seeming to ditch that big white lie which served as the mainstream s keystone anti-Russia trope since the last October, the New York Times has since tried to rehabilitate the narrative in Matthew Rosenburg s frail opus entitled, Trump Misleads on Russian Meddling: Why 17 Intelligence Agencies Don t Need to Agree. In other words, Yes, we misled the public on the 17 agencies tale, but he s still guilty. Assange InterventionThe most amazing turn in this story however, does not have to do with the contents of the emails, but rather who took them public first.We re told that someone had possession of the incriminating email chain, and had supplied this to the New York Times.On July 10th, while the story was still percolating, the New York Times boasted: The Times now has the email to Donald Trump Jr. offering Russian aid to incriminate Hillary. It seems that while the NYT was gloating over the potential of the story, editor Dean Baquet forgot the golden rule in investigative journalism: publish first, then celebrate. Champagne corks were already popping down on Eight Avenue in advance of the email release, and why not? They really believed they finally had a genuine Russiagate story this time.Here's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQ Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017Once Trump Jr tweeted out the email chain, the story suddenly shifted away from how damning the revelations are for the White House to how badly the New York Times fumbled this story. If Trump Jr hadn t released the emails, it s a near certainty that the NYT would have cropped and dripped out what it felt were the most juicy bits, and wrapped those in a prefabricated Russiagate narrative, to be disseminated to the Washington Post, CNN, NBC et all. .What incensed the media more than anything was that he had beaten the media to the story by releasing his own emails on Twitter. That canny move by Donald Jr was in part due to the timely intervention and advice by none other than Wikileaks founder Julian Assange who tweeted out after the fact:Contacted Trump Jr this morning on why he should publish his emails (i.e with us). Two hours later, does it himself: https://t.co/FzCttGSyr6 Julian Assange (@JulianAssange) July 11, 2017Later, Assange explained his actions on Twitter: I argued that his enemies have it so why not the public? His enemies will just milk isolated phrases for weeks or months with their own context, spin and according to their own strategic timetable. Better to be transparent and have the full context but would have been safer for us to publish it anonymously sourced. By publishing it himself it is easier to submit as evidence. Nonetheless, Donald Jr humiliated the New York Times. By telegraphing their story, they gave him an easy opening, in effect beating the New York Times and sucking any available oxygen out of the story.Slightly further up the leftwing of America s east coast intelligensia food chain, The Atlantic Magazine attempted to re-heat this fabulous nothing burger. With no real story to follow-up on, as a consolation prize, writer Mark Galeotti instead focused on the bizarre as its cast of characters surrounding this story as he tried to surmise how indicative of an unelected network of wealthy oligarchs, captains of industry and powerful corporations who really run things in Mother Russia. In essence, The Atlantic s Galeotti is complaining that there might actually be a Russian deep state permeating the halls of power in Moscow. He states: These hybrid relationships extend to virtually every arena of state business. The state media is an engine of propaganda. Private banks and businesspeople are, for the most part, exactly who and what they appear to be, but they are used to funnel money to sympathetic foreign parties and politicians when the Kremlin pleases. So, Russia has a deep state too. Is the United States, the UK, or any other Western country any different?Interestingly, it was The Atlantic who ran a host of Trump-related deep state articles through the latter part of the US election cycle. So it s: deep state in the USA = an acceptable fact of life, but deep state in Russia = an evil Putinism.Music promoter Rob Goldstone (Source: Mediaite)Who is Rob Goldstone? If there was ever a dodgy actor in this story, it s this man. We re told that the instigator-cum-middleman of this affair is one Rob Goldstone, a former Trump business associate from the Miss Universe event, and former promoter of Russian-based pop singer and businessman Emin Agalarov. According to the email chain, it was Agalarov who is said to have prompted the meeting at Trump Tower between Trump Jr and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, along with President Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort who was Trump s newly appointed campaign boss.Wayward music svengali Goldstone told the future US president s son, the crown prosecutor of Russia offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This has all the makings of a classic political set-up, with Goldstone positioned as the potential schlepper.Agalarov s family attorney Scott Balber told RT: Rob Goldstone was a publicist, a promoter for Emin s musical career. So, they certainly had a relationship in that regard, Balber said, adding that arranging a meeting about some top-secret information, allegedly coming from the Russian government, was obviously out of Goldstone s competence. Rob Goldstone is an entertainment industry publicist. So, I think it s fair to say that he was out of his alignment in making these communications. And what he said is not true. CNN s Kathy Griffin pictured here with Rob Goldstone, date and location of image unknown:Don't recall taking this photo with Russian intermediary Rob Goldstone, but I am in my Dynasty hat waiting for my interview with Mr. Mueller pic.twitter.com/VZ4iT1SuJX Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) July 10, 2017Goldstone appears to be a bit of an artful dodger who keeps some interesting company, including Kathy Griffin of CNN fame (see tweet above). Not surprisingly, Griffin can be seen on Twitter trying to milk the Trump Jr-Goldstone scandal for some extra publicity. It was Griffin, commonly referred to as a female comedian who had her CNN New Years Eve contract canceled following last month s mock ISIS-style beheading of President Trump.What REAL Collusion Looks likeThe word collusion is a new one for Americans. You almost never heard it before 2017. It came into our cultural lexicon after the previous two iterations of Russiagate were decommissioned due to repeated failures. The first iteration was Russian hacking of US elections which despite monumental efforts by the media and Democratic Party could not actually produce any evidence. Russian hacking was later downgraded to Russian meddling, which like the hacking meme, led absolutely nowhere. Then came collusion, which in the case of Trump, appears to be going nowhere. Since then, collusion has since been lowered to an effete, Russian influence. Back in January however, Politico revealed how the Clinton campaign had actually colluded with the Ukrainian government to spread anti-Trump stories and information during the 2016 election.Unlike the US liberal establishment s Russiagate Hoax, the Clinton-Ukraine story is real, and a definite breach of numerous codes, and possibly illegal. This incredible story was later summarized here by The Daily Caller:A veteran DNC operative who previously worked in the Clinton White House, Alexandra Chalupa, worked with Ukrainian government officials and journalists from both Ukraine and America to dig up Russia-related opposition research on Trump and Manafort. She also shared her anti-Trump research with both the DNC and the Clinton campaign, according to the Politico report. Chalupa met with Ukrainian Ambassador Valeriy Chaly and one of his aides, Oksara Shulyar, at the Ukrainian Embassy in March 2016 to talk about unearthing Paul Manafort s Russian connections, Chalupa admitted to Politico. Four days later, Trump officially hired Manafort. The day after Manafort s hiring was revealed, she briefed the DNC s communications staff on Manafort, Trump and their ties to Russia, according to an operative familiar with the situation, Politico reported.The Politico report also notes that the DNC encouraged Chalupa to try to arrange an interview with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to talk about Manafort s ties to the former pro-Russia president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, whom Manafort previously advised.To make matters worse, the Clinton campaign then actively coordinated a number of mainstream media journalists to spread the information:In one email released by WikiLeaks, Chalupa told Luis Miranda, then the DNC s communications director, that she was working with Yahoo News reporter Michael Isikoff and connected him to the Ukrainians. A lot more coming down the pipe. I spoke to a delegation of 68 investigative journalists from Ukraine last Wednesday at the Library of Congress the Open World Society s forum they put me on the program to speak specifically about Paul Manafort and I invited [Yahoo News reporter] Michael Isikoff whom I ve been working with for the past few weeks and connected him to the Ukrainians, Chalupa told Miranda. More offline tomorrow since there is a big Trump component you and Lauren need to be aware of that will hit in next few weeks and something I m working on you should be aware of. The Open World Leadership Center, which funded Chalupa s briefing of journalists about Manafort, is a taxpayer-funded congressional agency. Regarding the media colluding with Clinton, one of the most disturbing examples of this was when CNN s foreign affairs correspondent Elise Labott (image, left) was caught red-handed coordinating with former Hillary Clinton spokesman and State Department aid, Philippe Reines, on how to damage the public image of former GOP presidential candidate and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul during the 2013 Benghazi Hearings. A batch of emails which was released by Gawker showed how Labott took direction from Reines on how to craft tweets during the January 23, 2013 Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing. At the time, Senator Paul was pressing Clinton on the details of Benghazi, and the joint-attack by Reines and CNN s Labott looked very much like retribution. Both Labott and Reines conferred, before Labott tweeted to her followers: Sen Paul most critical on committee of Clinton, but a little late to the #Benghazi game. Not sure he was at many of the 30 previous briefings. This was a clear effort behind the scenes to defame a sitting US Senator by a member of the press colluding with a Clinton operative. You d think that Elise Labott would have been sacked for this, but after all it s CNN which means she not only kept her job, but probably got a pay rise to boot.We also learned how Clinton campaign operatives had paid large sums of cash to a shady Washington DC firm called Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Donald Trump. The firm was originally hired by rival GOP primary candidates to research Trump, but after Trump knocked out all 16 of his rivals and secured the Republican Party nomination, Fusion GPS was then re-hired by Democratic Party donors. Fusion GPS used a portion of that money to contract a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, in order to help produce what would later become known as the Trump Dossier which was then handed to one of the establishment s information laundromats, BuzzFeed (owned by NBCUniversal), which was then seized (surprise, surprise) by CNN. Both media outlets happily seized upon the bogus report, claiming to have damning new information on Donald Trump s ties with Russia. Steele s colorful report claimed that Russia s FSB intel agency had Kompromat on Trump gathered during a trip to Moscow in 2013. It was this incident which eventually prompted then President-elect Trump to christen CNN and its frivolous correspondent Jim Acosta as Fake News, widely regarded as a well-earned label and one which the network hasn t been able to shake off ever since.How this cartel of disinformation goes unregistered on the ethics meter by America s liberal establishment is shocking enough and speaks to both the built-in bias, and cognitive dissonance that plagues America s bustling partisan media and political establishments.Interestingly, UK website The Independent reported how Ms Veselnitskaya is believed to be linked to Fusion GPS. If there is any truth in that claim, then it could lend further credence to the idea that this entire scenario was an establishment stitch-up, possibly to snare the Trump camp in another Russian scandal. According to their report: A complaint filed last year claimed that GPS Fusion headed the pro-Russia campaign to kill the Magnitsky Act. Fusion GPS is the company behind the creation of the unsubstantiated dossier alleging a conspiracy between President Trump and Russia, Senator Chuck Grassley wrote in the letter. It is highly troubling that Fusion GPS appears to have been working with someone with ties to Russian intelligence let alone someone alleged to have conducted political disinformation campaigns as part of a pro-Russia lobbying effort while also simultaneously overseeing the creation of the Trump-Russia dossier. Did Fusion GPS arrange this meeting between Trump Jr and Veselnitskaya?The firm denies any involvement stating, Fusion GPS learned about this meeting from news reports and had no prior knowledge of it. Any claim that Fusion GPS arranged or facilitated this meeting in any way is false. But that rabbit hole leads somewhere, although it s not clear exactly where yet.We do know for sure: that the US mainstream media, especially the New York Times and CNN, cannot be trusted to cover this story fairly or accurately.Watch as 21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen discusses the media s dilemma with RT International on July 11th: *** Patrick Henningsen is an American-born writer and global affairs analyst and founder of independent news and analysis site 21st Century Wire and host of the SUNDAY WIRE weekly radio show broadcast globally over the Alternate Current Radio Network (ACR).READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",REAL
177,Eight Days to America s Armageddon,"Previous Eight Days to America s Armageddon 
We have eight days until America meets her ultimate fate and this is what we are about to inherit as a leader. 
Hillary s Epitaph 
By hook, or crook, this is who we are about to elect into the White House. This is what she s accomplished: Whitewater Sitting on the Board of LaFarge when the first payments were given to fund ISIS by LaFarge The first failed version of Obamacare when she was first lady Vince Foster The Travelgate scandal when she was the First Lady Selling 20% of America s uranium to the Russian (NY Times) TREASON Stealing $2 billion of Haitian relief money. Posting Ambassador Stevens travel plans prior to Benghazi ACCOMPLICE TO MURDER Benghazi The drug and money laundering of the Clinton Foundation Paying out 5% of the total proceeds of the Clinton Foundation to charity while pocketing the rest Using foreign money in Presidential campaign Pay for play- Perpetuating arms arms deals with nations that sponsor terrorism, when serving s Secretary of State, in exchange for payments to the Clinton Foundation Preparing to run to a country who has no extradition agreement with the United States in order to escape the justice that is coming her way (eg Qatar). The ongoing email scandal in which she obstructed justice by deleting 33,000 emails that were under investigation by Congress The ongoing email scandal in which she sent out emails with security designations as ABOVE TOP SECRET and she did so 22 times ESPIONAGE Refusing to step down and creating a constitutional crisis in a nation that is hopelessly divided already 
Hillary s new administration will consist of the following goals and this is not even being kept secret. Enacting the largest tax increase on Americans at $1.3 trillion dollars. The elimination of the family structure as we know it though increased power given to CPS around the country though Health and Human Services. Remember? It take a Village to Raise a Child? Or, was it the Village Idiot to Raise a Child? The elimination of inheritance. The elimination of Christianity. The elimination of free speech and she has made this one abundantly clear with her comments toward the alt. media. The elimination of free speech. The creation of a borderless nation. Increasing the importation of possible terrorists without national security vetting. The elimination of the Second Amendment. A President who will never leave office until she dies. 
We are witnessing the possible installation of the modern day version of Stalin as the President of the United States. 
I could go on and on, but fortunately, I still have a life that is worth living. 
The big question is this: Why aren t Americans from every race, color and religion in the streets demanding an end to her candidacy? 
I have written about this before, perhaps America is now ready to look at herself in the mirror. 
The following represents why America has not had enough of the criminality. The following 3 psychological principles have manifested in the form of a self-created prison that over half the country finds itself in. The CNN Effect-Group Think 
The world of psychological research provides the definitive answer as to whether we should fear our military in the coming storm ahead in the form of a phenomenon called group think . Group think is often described as a decision-making process whereby the group members go along with what they believe is the consensus. Group think has also been used to describe individual acquiescence to authority even when the authority has limited power to enforce compliance. Group think often causes groups to make hasty, irrational decisions, where individual doubts are set aside, for fear of upsetting the group s leadership and balance. The Migram Experiment 
The controversial 1963 experiment, known as the Milgram Experiment demonstrated that with very minimal verbal pressure, and nothing else, approximately 65% of the population will put someone to death based upon the orders of a perceived authority figure. And this occurs when the authority figure, in the Milgram experiment was not allowed to apply any REAL threats. For a complete description of the Milgram Experiment, please click here . 
The MSM tells America Trump cannot win, Hillary is good and Donald is bad. The political leaders, owned by the corporations who have been raping this country for 40 years tell us to vote for the criminal Clinton. And like good little sheep, we follow orders of the elite, just like the Nazis. 
IF the Media Tells the Lie Often Enough, the People Will Come to Believe It: Confirmation Bias 
We ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the public believes is false. 
William Casey, former CIA Director Confirmation bias is the same in any tyrannical form of government. 
The social psychological term, confirmation bias, refers to the fact that the masses will believe even the biggest of lies, if they hear it often enough. Confirmation bias and group think work hand in hand to enslave Americans into believing in and accepting a self-destructive paradigm. Television MSM news has a filtering impact on the perception of reality . The psychological concept of confirmation bias means that when we hear a message often enough, we come to unquestionably accept the message as authentic and real. And the message is amazingly consistent because only six globalist corporate entities control over 95% of the media. 
Donald Trump is racist! You have heard it before and you will keep hearing it until every nonwhite person in America believes that if he elected, America will see a race war. 


Racist and sexist, that s Donald Trump and we hear this over and over and over and the unaware masses in this country come to believe as the real facts fade into the background. Trump Cannot Win According to the Polls, Says the MSM and It Doesn t Matter What You Do- Learned Helplessness 
Why won t America stand up for herself? Why is the country, once a country which possessed courage and conviction, now sitting idly while allowing itself to be taken to the slaughter without so much as a whimper? 
The answer to the above question lies in the psychological concept known as Learned Helplessness as discovered by Martin Seligman in the 1960 s. 
Learned helplessness occurs when an animal, or a person, is repeatedly subjected to an aversive stimulus that it cannot escape from. Eventually, the animal will stop trying to avoid the stimulus and behave as if it is utterly helpless to change the situation. Even when opportunities to escape are presented, this learned helplessness will prevent any action . 


Phase One 
In the first phase of the learned helplessness experiment, Seligman placed a dog on an electrical grid, shocked the dog and noted that the dog would demonstrate the ability to escape the aversive stimulus. 
Phase Two 
In the second phase, the dog was barricaded on the grid and was unable to escape the painful shocks. Eventually the dog laid down and passively accepted the shock. 
Phase Three 
Seligman then removed the barricades and the dog could have easily escaped the shocks. However, the dog, conditioned by the prior set of events, simply laid down and accepted the shocks, without mounting any resistance whatsoever. This, in large part, is where America is at today. 
Trump has removed the barrier (phase three) and America has a chance to redeem herself in the eyes of God. We have a chance to reclaim a measure of respectability from the criminal enterprise system that we presently under. 
It does not matter if you vote. Trump cannot win, says the globalist controlled media. The research shows us that one factor, and only one factor, can move the masses to action. When people see their loved ones in danger (ie cannot feed their children), they will act with purpose. This is the angle that the awake must use to awaken the sleeping sheep in this country. Do I think it is going to happen, I don t think so. However, if we all get on our knees and pray to God for forgiveness and deliverance, we might be surprised at what happens. There are only 8 days to America s Armageddon",REAL
178,Fake News: The Unravelling of US Empire From Within,"Setting the Stage of the Press-President War.US ruling ideology and Washington power have become unstuck as never before. A war of opposing certitudes and denunciations is waged day to day between the long-ruling US corporate media and the White House. Both continuously proclaim ringing recriminations of the other s fake news . Over months they both portray each other as malevolent liars. Prof. John McMurtry Global ResearchUS bully pulpits are now beyond show disagreements and successful media inquisitions of the past. Slanderous accusations long confined to vilifying the designated Enemy have crept into accusations of the President himself. The Russians are coming is returning as the final recourse of smear to stop deviations from the global program of hugely profitable enemy hate and perpetual preparations for foreign war.The ruling big lies of the US money party and corporate globalization have divided into opposing camps. The Press and the President denounce each other non-stop on the public stage, while US dark state agents take sides behind the scenes.Fake news is the medium of battle.Tracking the Real Fake News Built into Corporate GlobalizationBeneath the civil war of official narratives, cognitive space opens for truth long suffocated by the Washington Consensus . Even the US-led G-20 has recently agreed not to automatically condemn protectionism as an economic evil. The battle slogan of transnational corporate rule over 30 years has been quietly withdrawn on the global stage.Is the big lie of free trade finally coming to ground? It has long led the hollowing out of societies and life support systems across the world in a false mass promotion as freedom and prosperity for all . In fact beneath the pervasive fake news, a closed-door transnational corporate command system forces all enterprises across borders into a carbon-multiplying trade regime with thousands of rules to protect the transnational corporate looting and ruin of home economies and environments as the only rights enforced.Propagandist names and fake freedoms are proclaimed everywhere to conceal the reality. The corporate-investor regime has stripped out almost all evolved protections of workers, ecologies and social infrastructures. Non-stop liquidations and roboticizations of local jobs and enterprises are reversed in meaning to jobs, jobs, jobs and higher living standards , the very opposite of the facts. Destabilization and bombing wars attack resource-rich and air-defenceless societies outside the circle of treaty subjugation.False news allows every step. Even the happy-face Trudeau regime is taken aback by the tidal shift to national priorities. Its ministers scuttle around the US in near panic to find common cause for restoring the unaccountable regime. Multiplying carbon, disemployment and ecological plunder are ignored throughout in the longest standing fake news of all economic growth .In fact, there is no real economic growth in universal life necessities or reduction of waste. The only growth is of volumes and velocities of transnational money exchanges, foreign commodities, and private profits to the top. More prosperity for nations and the world means, decoded, more transnational corporate-state treaties to deprive nations of their rights to organization and production for citizens real needs as well as organically regulated protection of environments and ecosystems.The consequences covered over by pervasively false cover stories are speeded-up ecocidal extractions, permanent disemployments, and wastes hemorrhaging into cumulatively more polluted oceans, air, atmosphere and life habitats. Corporate-state solutions of carbon markets for pollution rights have nowhere reduced any of these life-and-death crises, but only further and selectively enriched transnational corporations.As for the Obama solution, we need more Canadas , fake news again conceals the reality. Beneath the global celebrity hype covering empty and broken promises, Canada s Trudeau regime is essentially a brand change of PM rhetoric to advance transnational corporate dictates as free trade and to ensure oil pipelines out of the most polluting oil basin in the world, Alberta s tar-sands, are built through water basins and indigenous lands across Canada and the US. One cannot help but observe this is Trump s plan too, and overrides Trudeau s promises to protect Canada s first peoples.I recently sent a letter to my local MP requesting evidence for what PM Trudeau promises over months of repetition that more free trade means a better life for those in the middle class and those wanting to join the middle class . As always, there is no evidence to support the non-stop false news from the PMO. Revealingly, the middle class turns out to be people making $180,000 a year slated to get significant tax cuts.Trump s rogue elephant charge on Washington-led lies, war, and dispossession of the working class is no solution to life-blind corporate globalization. Trump in office is a US nationalist oligarch commanding policies even more blindly rapacious in despoliation of the environment and transferring far more public wealth to the rich.The common ground of all our lives, collective life capital, does not exist for any government in the free world or any policy of globalization . The lies that must be promulgated to advance the private corporate agenda are built into its transnational command system from the beginning.Out of the Ruling Memory Hole with the Internet CommonsJoining the dots shows that every step of US money-party globalization has, in fact, been driven by fake news.No corporate media tolerance has been given in a quarter of a century to any voice demanding accountability to the common life-ground of citizens. A new game of numbers has proceeded instead. At most, a euphemistic climate change has been endlessly debated while the totalizing destabilization of human and planetary life cycles remains without a name or collective response. Only more profitable market panaceas which do not reduce any pollution continue to divert from the deepest degenerate trends destroying the planetary life host.On the upside, the big lies of free trade and humanitarian wars have been called into official question for the first time by the Trump presidential campaign, and he has been elected against the official line. Yet opposing camps are still at each other s throats. So the perpetual fallback on accusing the long-designated foreign enemy is triggered by the fallen establishment. The fake news chorus of Russia s aggressions now includes collusion of the Trump administration with its officials to win the US election. This mainspring diversion from reality is called back from the dead witch-hunts of the past. As then tool, facts do not count, only accusations do. The official media line is almost predictable: Russia is behind Trump s election victory. As always, reverse projection is the mass-psyche operation to blame an official Enemy to divert attention from the life-and-death facts. The Enemy is once again accused of doing what the US has always done worse as the reason for attacking It. Russia is the usual placeholder in this reverse-blame operation. The 2016 US election of Trump is the latest variation.Meanwhile throughout the election and its aftermath, the new transnational internet commons including Wiki-leaks over a decade has increasingly laid bare the greatest propaganda machine in history now in many-leveled crisis. The long normalized half-truths, one-sided slanting of the facts, and non-stop fallacies of inference are coming out into the open as never before. The pretexts and lies for US imperial bullying and war are exposed beyond any corporate-media gate.This time the accusation is interference and attack on the US presidential election with no evidence of wrongdoing or vote manipulation whatsoever. Yet as in the long past, the method is smear with no evidence for the accusations. Ever more media repetition and shadowy insinuation does the job. It has always worked before, why not again since all the other media buttons pushed on taking down the Trump peace initiatives with Russia and opposition to globalization of US jobs have failed.Having wondered during the election campaign whether we could be friends with Russia and promoted diplomatic relations into his administration, Trump can be named as the enemy in hiding to be rooted out. The real problem the fake news never mentions is that he threatens the cornerstone of the US war state over 70 years.So when Trump won the election with his heresy still intact, the ever-ready accusation of evil-Russia connection moves into high gear although the target is the opposite of communist and an epitome of capitalist riches and connections. We see here the historical mind-lock compulsion to blame the Enemy Russia and smear whoever dissents from it, even if it is a bully-capitalist president. There are very big stakes in keeping the game going.Yet the no-profit and unpaid analyses from the internet commons have no such ulterior motive and interest in false accusations. With more objectively informed analysts than the commercial press and unimpeachable facts like WikiLeaks going to tens of millions of readers across the world, the genie is out of the bottle. The official grand narrative and its normalized big lies are coming apart at the seams.So blame as usual is diverted onto the accepted Enemy, now conniving with Trump to attack the 2016 US presidential election. Beneath the fake news, the fact is that positive diplomatic relations with Russia not only threaten to stop the highly profitable permanent war against it, but spike the longest pretext for US war and military domination now moving through Ukraine.The free internet commons cannot be gagged for telling the truth. Freedom of speech in the US cannot be openly stopped without fatal loss of legitimacy of rule.So the rest follows. All the non-corporate and non-profit messages from the critical sites on the internet commons which are speaking against the US war state inside are now vilified as fake news . A third, unofficial protagonist has entered the battle with no private profit or career motive or corporate boss to serve and a wealth of proven professional knowledge and talent at work. It has to be denounced to sustain the big lies of the ruling money-war game which is in deepening crises and conflicts all the way to the unprecedented US President-Press civil war.The Harvard Proclamation of a New Memory HoleThe innermost fount of US ideology and war, Harvard University, has now stepped in. It is officially naming and denouncing US-critical internet sites for fake news .Not even the medieval Church went so far in its Index Librorum Prohibitorum of prohibited writings. It was at least innocent of scientific method and openly declared its dogmas. Not Harvard.Underneath notice, all the sites it attacks are internet commons, and none are financed by private corporate donors and captive institutions while Harvard and the corporate media are. This is the real battle agenda underneath, the long war to privatize the news for profit as everything else with anti-establishment internet criticism now the target.In the background, Harvard University has long propagated an unexamined academic method. It normally cuts off any faculty or learned source of opposition to the private corporate rule of America and the wars of aggression to impose it on the world. Accordingly, the underling grand narrative equations of the US is Good and the designated Enemy is Evil is not questioned. It is presupposed. Malevolent motives are always assumed of the designated Enemy, down to Harvard-produced geostrategic economic and war models. So when a host of internet commons sites challenge the grand narrative framework, Harvard and satellites denounce them to stop people reading them. A long list of critical sites is accused without criteria, proof or evidence as all spreaders of fake news .What is not recognised here is that only on the internet commons can the process of truth be free from ruling pressures to control message for external sponsors.Here there is no commercial-profit condition to speak and write, and no livelihood dependence on private profit. There is no inducement to avoid life-and-death issues in academic obfuscation or ad-vehicle style. Internet authors not on the payroll can be free of the game of all games behind the scenes enriching the rich further with no life-coherent criterion of truth.These underlying conditions of the internet commons and free speech itself cannot be recognised by the academy or the corporate press without undercutting their proclaimed status as the only legitimate founts of truth. The internet commons is a new world of competitive capacities to research, understand and disseminate not bound by private money patronage (as over centuries in Harvard University).When challenged in this way, Harvard (and the official press) are set back on their heels. They cannot think the facts through because their instituted presumptions have long been what they must presuppose and not question to acquire their credentials and pay for public speech. They must attack what calls all this into question if it effectively speaks truth to power to expose or de-legitimate the ruling system narrative as false. Harvard and the US press thus follow the reigning method of reverse projection. They accuse the effective opposition of fake news .The most revealing fact here is that Harvard authority as other academic administrations proceed in name-calling without any valid argument or demonstration the very basis of reasonable conclusion. Yet this is such a long tradition of presumptive accusation allowed against anyone designated as the Enemy, and anyone else exposing the falsehood of the ruling US story of moral superiority over all others and God s blessing to lead the world by force or money.This is why only dissenting sites from the official storyline of US freedom and rightness in all things are accused as fake news . Accusation of opposing positions is so well-worn into conditioned brains that endless repetition locks it in as self-evident. This is why attributions of vile motive are automatic from Harvard or the New York Times for any outside leader opposing US interference in their countries including elections. US hypocrisy here is staggering, but unreported. In fact, Harvard s life-blind elite of war criminal geo-strategists, economic modellers and so on are fawned upon within the wider corporate rule they serve.None can engage critical facts and thought challenging the US moral superiority assumptions because they have never been required to consider them. So they denounce them as once the Church denounced apostasy.In the end, US system worship is a war-state religion. It eliminates all enemies to its right to rule. Its globalizing system institutes the market laws of God. War crimes are God-blessed justice.Freedom of Speech, the Process of Truth, and the US ConstitutionLed by senior academics, journalists and technical expertise, the internet commons provide for the first time impartial witness and free speech open to public examination and circulation across borders. They are free from corporate-rank dictate and private copy-right control.In consequence, the internet commons are liberated from private corporate profit as controlling goal. Those who know what they are talking about can speak truth to dogma and power without words to appease editors, business boards and ad revenues. Truth itself is not defined, but its principle of process is a more inclusively consistent taking into account towards life-coherent conclusionDespite Google black-holing of radical legal facts, CIA penetration of Wikipedia, and so on, the internet commons freedom of speech is far beyond anything guaranteed in the US constitution. In fact, the sacred US Constitution that all presidents give oath to preserve, protect and defend guarantees in the end only freedom of public speech to private money demand.Long before the Supreme Court s 2010 decision reverse-titled as Citizens United , the US constitution was structured to one overriding end to remove prior limits to private-money right over all else,including to begin, the rule of British law and the lands of the first nations West of the Appalachians.This is why no common life interest exists in the US Constitution from the start. People s universal human life necessities of water, food, protection and liveable environment are ruled out a-priori. This is why civil rights themselves were first federally enforced by the commerce clause protecting freedom of commercial bus passengers including blacks to cross borders.It is also why the Fourteenth Amendment to protect the equal rights of freed slaves ended up being the legal basis for private-profit corporations and wealthy funds to acquire the constitutional rights of living persons (e.g., to freedom of speech for big money to buy elections and to avoid government access to financial records).Even the iconic rights of life, liberty and happiness turn out to be in fact only private market rightswhich allow corporate fictive persons to unlimited money wealth, protection against public redistribution, and the freedom of private wealth alone to speak to America by buying corporate self promotions and election attack ads.The US Constitution fix goes all the way back to 1787. As professor of constitutional law at Chicago s iconic Kent College of Law, Matthew Stanton, explains in personal correspondence: [The fix] goes all the way back to the 1787 coup where the 39 signatories to the Constitution sequestered themselves in a Philadelphia meeting house, with locked doors and shuttered windows, to ostensibly make adjustments to the Articles of Confederation, but instead delivered an entirely new document that enabled creating a federal system centralizing control of the economy by propertied wealth .Russia the Enemy: the Deus ex Machina of Fake NewsWe may recall that the corporate-press and Wall-Street-enriched candidate for the presidency, Hillary Clinton, started the accusation of fake news to explain her defeat. As establishment mask of the politically correct masses with the money-war party as her paymaster, Clinton blamed her fall in the 2016 US election on the new enemy she saw arising against the official story and herself. When the glass mirror story line did not take, she joined forces with the corporate media on another plane. Fake news misled Americans. The New York Times, the Washington Post, the TV Networks, and other establishment tale tellers saw pay-dirt far beyond Clinton s failed bid for president.In fact, the corporate mass media were losing marketability by the escalating appeal of free social media. The once all-powerful press propaganda system has been increasingly deserted. The fake news story provided a media base to condemn free internet news and commentary as immoral. The 2016 election became the leverage for a big market grab back.Very soon it was not just fake news to spike news cycles and subscriptions. War as peace and corporate globalization as freedom found its long place of rule the enemy of Russia to blame. Now the news can be that Russia hacked and attacked the lost 2016 election. Russia may be a hollowed-out shell by global corporate and oligarch dispossession. But it can still continue as pretext for US-NATO war crimes and aggression reverse-blamed on it. As the European breadbasket and newly discovered fossil-fuel rich nation, Ukraine is a very big prize. Now in Ukraine s US-led coup aftermath and ethnic civil war, evil Russia can be an ace card again to accuse for attacking the US election.Since Russia led by Putin is drawing the line as in Crimea to support the Russia-speaking region against US-led war crimes under international law (documented in previous articles), all roads connect. Russia s uncontrolled aggression is reverse-projected onto the victim again in a glorious new use. Reverse blame it for interference in the US election of Trump and kill Russia-US peace initiatives at the same time. No fact is required to verify the accusation, and no law broken is needed to insinuate treason of whoever relates with Russia s officials in peace initiative. It can work even against an elected US president.At the same time, the US s own record attacking other nations elections and societies is thereby erased as well continually orchestrating mass-murder and dictatorship to sabotage the electoral process from Vietnam and Chile to Ukraine in 2010 and Latin America social democracies since.If it were a story of reverse projection by a mass-murderous psychopath, it would be too much to believe. Yet it now runs the US news cycle as the big story unfolding with no evidence of US illegality, force, or non-compliance with international law. The accusations run by themselves in US media culture and across the empire. So as 2017 Spring breaks, endless media insinuations of treason seep into the populace from corporate media sites across borders with backrooms and Congress setting up for another presidential inquisition.It is interesting to observe two precedents. Past inquisitions were unfolded soon after Bill Clinton said in India, it s time to level up rather than down in global trade and Richard Nixon founded the Environmental Protections Agency, stopped corporations from outsourcing US jobs, and made peace with China as Trump sought with Russia.The ludicrous hypocrisy, factual vacuum, and war-drums of blame-the-enemy go into high-volume operation again, led by an attack-dog media against the elected US president whose only action has been to have business-like relations with Russia. Few observe the immense stakes of the US media and war establishments in this process.

180,This Sickening Pro-Gun Meme Is Quite Possibly The Most Vile Thing On The Internet (IMAGE),"The pro-gun crowd loves guns first, and respect last. At least, that seems to be the case with whoever made a truly horrible meme out of an old black-and-white war photo. The photo depicts troops executing a couple of people in the back as they kneel in front of a mass grave. The troops are just obeying orders, and the dead in the mass grave are citizens obeying gun laws. This is the meme:Image via TwitterWe don t know who created this, but we don t have enough middle fingers to express how we feel about them. The piece of shit behind this is no doubt someone who believes the lie that, had the Jewish citizens of Germany and elsewhere just had guns, the Holocaust wouldn t have happened.The photo in the meme is from the German-occupied Soviet Union, and depicts one of the mobile execution squads known as the Einsatzgr ppen. They were tasked with mass executions of Jews, communists, and anyone else that the Nazis decided weren t suitable to living their empire and master race. Tens of thousands were murdered this way they are part of the Holocaust.The myth of guns and the Holocaust is so completely and terribly wrong it defies description. Yes, the Nazis seized guns from their enemies, however, they actually didn t make much of a dent in total gun circulation in Germany, contrary to what the gun-rights crowd wants us to believe.Furthermore, the Nazis actually loosened gun laws in 1938 for everyone except Jews. People who have a basic understanding of Nazi Germany know that the Nazis targeted more groups than Jews, and they know that more people than Jews opposed the Nazis however quietly they had to.Why didn t those people, who could own guns, rise up? It s because of the power of a police state the very thing the moar gunz crowd fears the most.Therefore, the cretin who came up with this meme can rightfully be termed as having no clue what they are talking about. But worse than that, they have no problem whatsoever with using the horror of the Holocaust to further their all guns all the time agenda. That is just abominable, and has no place in any discourse at all. Here s why: This historical second-guessing is deeply offensive to Jews, Holocaust survivors and those who valiantly fought against Hitler during World War II. It is, in fact, as many historians have previously noted, a distortion of history itself When you manipulate the history of the Holocaust and use it to score political points, its wholly inappropriate and offensive. Especially for the sake of the victims of the Nazi onslaught and their memory, it must stop. That s from Jonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League. He was speaking against Ben Carson s painfully offensive assertion that the Nazis had disarmed everyone so they could kill Jews with impunity, but it s just not true. And it s an serious affront to every single victim of the Nazis, as well as everyone who fought them.This meme s creator ought to go back to the depths of the hellish abyss that first spat him out.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",REAL

233,PKS Kritik Jokowi Soal 2024 Jatah Prabowo: Presiden Seharusnya Netral Seperti SBY Tidak Partisan,"Wakil Ketua Majelis Syuro DPP PKS Hidayat Nur Wahid mengkritik dukungan terbuka Jokowi kepada Prabowo Subianto dengan mengatakan bahwa Pilpres 2024 milik sang Ketua Umum Gerindra.

Menurut Hidayat pernyataan Jokowi berpotensi menjadikan kontestasi Pilpres 2024 tidak netral.

""Disayangkan sekali pernyataan beliau itu disadari atau tidak menghadirkan campur tangan kekuasaan terhadap proses pilpres yang steril dari campur tangan kekuasaan,"" kata Hidayat saat dihubungi Narasi, Selasa (8/11/2022).

Hidayat mengingatkan dalam diri Jokowi melekat jabatan seorang presiden. Dalam kapasitas itu Jokowi mestinya bisa menempatkan diri sebagai negara dengan menunjukan sikap netral pemerintah dalam proses penentuan capres.

Wakil Ketua MPR RI ini lalu mencontohkan sikap Susilo Bambang Yudhyono menjelang akhir kekuasaannya di periode kedua. Hidayat mengatakan kala Itu SBY benar-benar besikap netral dengan tidak menjadi partisan pendukung salah satu calon atau partai politik tertentu.

""Saya kira sangat baik kalau kenegarawan beliau betul-betul dijaga dan mengikuti seperti yang dilakukan Pak SBY. Pak SBY pada periode kedua kepresidenannya betul-betul netral beliau. Beliau imparsial dan tidak partisan kepada capres, calon, dan partai politik tertentu. Maka Pak SBY meninggalkan legacy tentang kenegarawanan,"" kata Hidayat.""Saya kira itu yang mestinya dilakukan oleh Pak Jokowi.""

Hidayat juga berpendapat Jokowi tidak semestinya memberikan kriteria calon presiden mendatang. Sebab sikap semacam itu menurut Hidayat bisa saja diterjemahkan sebagai intervensi seorang penguasa.

“Enggak perlu juga beliau menyampaikan kriteria-kriteria. Rakyat sudah lebih mengerti tentang kriteria presiden yang akan datang. Yang beliau anggap sebagai kriteria juga bisa menjadi bumerang terhadap beliau sendiri. Sudahlah rakyat sudah cerdas. Jangan diintervensi dengan penyebutan nama calon atau dukungan,” ujar Hidayat.

Hidayat mengatakan apa pun alasannya, guyon atau bukan, tidak sepantasnya Jokowi menyampaikan dukungan terbuka kepada Prabowo.

“Saya sangat menyayangkan pernyataan beliau karena itu bukan sekedar pernyataan pribadi, itu merupakan pernyataan seorang presiden yang waktu itu diminta untuk memberikan sambutan,"" kata Hidayat.",REAL
